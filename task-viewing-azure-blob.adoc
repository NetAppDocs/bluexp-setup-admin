After you install a Connector in Azure, BlueXP can automatically discover information about the Azure storage accounts that reside in the Azure Subscriptions where the Connector is installed. An Azure Blob working environment is added to the Canvas so you can view this information.

You can see details about your Azure storage accounts, including the location, resource group, total and used capacity, and more. These accounts can be used as destinations for BlueXP backup and recovery, BlueXP tiering, or BlueXP copy and sync operations.
