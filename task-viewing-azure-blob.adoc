You can see details about your Azure storage accounts, including the location, resource group, total and used capacity, and more. These accounts can be used as destinations for BlueXP backup and recovery, BlueXP tiering, or BlueXP copy and sync operations.

A newly added feature now enables you to create and edit Azure storage accounts. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-blob-storage/index.html[Go here to see how you can view, create, and manage your Azure storage accounts using BlueXP^].
