Get started with BlueXP in private mode by preparing your environment and deploying the Connector.

Private mode is typically used with secure regions, including https://aws.amazon.com/federal/secret-cloud/[AWS Secret Cloud^], https://aws.amazon.com/federal/top-secret-cloud/[AWS Top Secret Cloud^], and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-dod-il6[Azure IL6^]

Before you get started, you should have an understanding of link:concept-netapp-accounts.html[BlueXP accounts], link:concept-connectors.html[Connectors], and link:concept-modes.html[deployment modes].

.. Prepare a dedicated Linux host that meets requirements for CPU, RAM, disk space, Docker Engine, and more.

.. Set up networking that provides access to the target networks.

.. For cloud deployments, set up permissions in your cloud provider so that you can associate those permissions with the Connector after you install the software.
