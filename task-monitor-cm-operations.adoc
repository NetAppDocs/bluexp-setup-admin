You can monitor the status of the operations that Cloud Manager is performing to see if there are any issues that you need to address. You can view the status in the Notification Center, in the Timeline, or have notifications sent to your email.

This table provides a comparison of the Notification Center and the Timeline so you can understand what each has to offer.

== Monitoring activities using the Notification Center

Notifications track the progress of operations that you've initiated in Cloud Manager so you can verify whether the operation was successful or not. They enable you to view the status for many Cloud Manager operations that you initiated during your current login session.
// Notifications can even prompt you to retry a failed operation.

You can display the notifications by clicking the notification bell (image:icon_bell.png[notification bell]) in the menu bar. The color of the little bubble in the bell indicates the highest level severity notification that is active. So if you see a red bubble, it means there's an important notification that you should look at.

You can also configure Cloud Manager to send notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system. Emails can be sent to any Cloud Central users who are part of your NetApp Cloud Account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity. See <<Setting email notification settings,Setting email notification settings>> below.

=== Notification types

Notifications are classified in the following categories:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,55",width="90%"]
|===

| Notification type
| Description

| Critical | A problem occurred that might lead to service disruption if corrective action is not taken immediately.
| Error | An action or process ended with failure, or could lead to failure if corrective action is not taken.
| Warning  | An issue that you should be aware of to make sure it does not reach the critical severity. Notifications of this severity do not cause service disruption, and immediate corrective action might not be required.
| Recommendation | A system recommendation for you to take an action to improve the system or a certain service; for example: costs saving, suggestion for new services, recommended security configuration, etc.
| Information | A message that provides additional information about an action or process.
| Success | An action or process completed successfully.

=== Filtering notifications

By default you'll see all notifications. You can filter the notifications that you see in the Notification Center to show only those notifications that are important to you. You can filter by Cloud Manager "Service" and by notification "Type".

image:screenshot_notification_filters.png[A screenshot showing the two types of filters available in the Notification Center.]

For example, if you want to see only "Error" and "Warning" notifications for Cloud Manager operations, select those entries and you'll see only those types of notifications.

// === Selecting which account and which user notifications you will see
//
// By default, you'll see only your notification in the current account. You can choose to view notifications for the current account or all accounts, and you can choose to view notifications for your actions or all user actions.

//
// . Choose from the following options:

// * Show notifications for just your user login, or for all users in the account.

=== Setting email notification settings

You can send specific types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into Cloud Manager. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your NetApp Account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity.

By default, Account Admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" notifications. All other users and recipients are configured, by default, not to receive any notification emails.

You must be an Account Admin to customize the notifications settings.

.Steps

. From the Cloud Manager menu bar, click *Settings > Alerts and Notifications Settings*.

* To make changes for multiple users, check the box for each user, click *Manage Email Notifications*, check the types of Notifications to be sent, and click *Apply*.

=== Adding additional email recipients

The users who appear in the _Account Users_ tab are populated automatically from the users in your NetApp Account (from the link:task-managing-netapp-accounts.html#creating-and-managing-users[Manage Account page]). You can add email addresses in the _Additional Recipients_ tab for other people, or groups, who do not have access to Cloud Manager, but who need to be notified about certain types of alerts and notifications.

.Steps

To dismiss all notifications, in the Notification Center, click image:button_3_vert_dots.png[] and select *Dismiss All*.

== Auditing user activity in your account

The Timeline in Cloud Manager shows the actions that users completed to manage your account. This includes management actions such as associating users, creating workspaces, creating Connectors, and more.

Checking the Timeline can be helpful if you need to identify who performed a specific action, or if you need to identify the status of an action.

.Steps

. From the left navigation menu, select *Timeline*.

. Under the Filters, click *Service*, enable *Tenancy*, and click *Apply*.

.Result

The Timeline updates to show you account management actions.
