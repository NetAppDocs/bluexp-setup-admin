You can monitor the status of the operations that BlueXP is performing to see if there are any issues that you need to address. You can view the status in the Timeline, the Notification Center, or have notifications sent to your email.

The table compares the Timeline and Notification Center to highlight their features.

== Audit user activity from the BlueXP timeline

The Timeline shows the actions that users completed to manage your organization or account. This includes management actions such as associating users, creating working environments, creating Connectors, and more.

The Timeline helps identify who performed an action or its status.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Timeline*.

. Use the filters above the table to change which actions display in the table.
+
For example, you can use the *Service* filter to show actions related to a specific BlueXP service, or you can use the *User* filter to show actions related to a specific user account.

=== Download audit logs from the Timeline
You can download the audit logs from the Timeline to a CSV file. This enables you to keep a record of the actions that users performed in your organization. The downloaded CSV file contains all available columns from the Timeline, regardless of which ones you are filtering or displaying in the Timeline.

.Steps
. In the Timeline, select the download icon in the upper right corner of the table.

== Monitor activities using the Notification Center

Notifications track the progress of your BlueXP operations to verify success. They enable you to view the status for many BlueXP actions that you initiated during your current login session. Not all BlueXP services report information into the Notification Center at this time.

You can display the notifications by selecting the notification bell (image:icon_bell.png[notification bell]) in the menu bar. The color of the little bubble in the bell indicates the highest level severity notification that is active. So if you see a red bubble, it means there's an important notification that you should look at.

You can also configure BlueXP to send certain types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your BlueXP organization or account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity. See how to <<Set email notification settings,set email notification settings>>.

=== Comparing the Notification Center with BlueXP alerts

The Notification Center enables you to view the status of operations you've initiated from BlueXP and set up alert notifications for certain types of system activities. Meanwhile, BlueXP alerts enables you to view issues or potential risks in your ONTAP storage environment related to capacity, availability, performance, protection, and security.

=== Notification types

BlueXP classifies notifications into the following categories:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="20,60",width="85%"]
|===

| Notification type
| Description

| Critical | A problem occurred that might lead to service disruption if corrective action is not taken immediately.
| Error | An action or process ended with failure, or could lead to failure if corrective action is not taken.
| Warning  | An issue that you should be aware of to make sure it does not reach the critical severity. Notifications of this severity do not cause service disruption, and immediate corrective action might not be required.
| Recommendation | A system recommendation for you to take an action to improve the system or a certain service; for example: costs saving, suggestion for new services, recommended security configuration, etc.
| Information | A message that provides additional information about an action or process.
| Success | An action or process completed successfully.

|===

=== Filter notifications

By default you'll see all active notifications in the Notification Center. You can filter the notifications that you see to show only those notifications that are important to you. You can filter by BlueXP "Service" and by notification "Type".

image:screenshot_notification_filters.png[A screenshot showing the two types of filters available in the Notification Center.]

For example, if you want to see only "Error" and "Warning" notifications for BlueXP operations, select those entries and you'll see only those types of notifications.

=== Dismiss notifications

You can remove notifications from the page if you no longer need to see them. You can dismiss notifications individually or all at once.

To dismiss all notifications, in the Notification Center, select image:button_3_vert_dots.png[an icon with three vertical dots] and select *Dismiss All*.
image:screenshot_notification_menu.png[A screenshot showing the Notifications menu to select settings and dismiss all options.]

To dismiss individual notifications, hover your cursor over the notification and select *Dismiss*.

=== Set email notification settings

You can send specific types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into BlueXP. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your BlueXP organization or account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity.

[NOTE]
====
* BlueXP sends email notifications for the Connector, digital wallet, copy and sync, and backup and recovery.
* Sending email notifications is not supported when the Connector is installed in a site without internet access.
====

The filters you set in the Notification Center do not determine the types of notifications you'll receive by email. By default, any BlueXP admin will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" notifications. These notifications are across all services - you can't choose to receive notifications for only certain services, for example Connectors or BlueXP backup and recovery. 

All other users and recipients are configured not to receive any notification emails - so you'll need to configure notification settings for any additional users. 

You must have the Organization admin role to customize the notifications settings.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu bar, select *Settings > Alerts and Notifications Settings*.
+

. Select a user, or multiple users, from either the _Users_ tab or the _Additional Recipients_ tab, and choose the type of notifications to be sent:

* To make changes for a single user, select the menu in the Notifications column for that user, check the types of Notifications to be sent, and select *Apply*.
* To make changes for multiple users, check the box for each user, select *Manage Email Notifications*, check the types of Notifications to be sent, and select *Apply*.

=== Add additional email recipients

The users who appear in the _Users_ tab are populated automatically from the users in your organization or account. You can add email addresses in the _Additional Recipients_ tab for other people, or groups, who do not have access to BlueXP, but who need to be notified about certain types of alerts and notifications.

.Steps

. From the Alerts and Notifications Settings page, select *Add New Recipients*.
+

. Enter the name, email address, and select the types of Notifications that recipient will receive, and select *Add New Recipient*.
