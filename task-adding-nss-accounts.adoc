Associate a NetApp Support Site account with your BlueXP organization or account to enable key workflows for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. These NSS credentials are associated with the entire BlueXP organization or account.

BlueXP also supports associating one NSS account per BlueXP user account. link:task-manage-user-credentials.html[Learn how to manage user-level credentials].

TIP: If you're using BlueXP in standard mode, you'll have a _BlueXP organization_, which you manage using BlueXP identity and access management (IAM). But if you're using BlueXP in restricted mode or private mode, then you'll have a _BlueXP account_.

== Overview

Associating NetApp Support Site credentials with your specific BlueXP account serial number is required to enable the following tasks in BlueXP:

* Deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP when you bring your own license (BYOL)
+
Providing your NSS account is required so that BlueXP can upload your license key and to enable the subscription for the term that you purchased. This includes automatic updates for term renewals.

* Registering pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems
+
Providing your NSS account is required to activate support for your system and to gain access to NetApp technical support resources.

* Upgrading Cloud Volumes ONTAP software to the latest release

These credentials are associated with your specific BlueXP account serial number. Users who belong to the BlueXP organization or account can access these credentials from *Support > NSS Management*.

== Add an NSS account

The Support Dashboard enables you to add and manage your NetApp Support Site accounts for use with BlueXP at the BlueXP organization or account level.

* If you have a customer-level account, you can add one or more NSS accounts.

* If you have a partner or reseller account, you can add one or more NSS accounts, but they can't be added alongside customer-level accounts.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Help icon, and select *Support*.
+
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/bluexp-family/main/media/screenshot-help-support.png[A screenshot of the Help menu where Support is the first option listed]

. Select *NSS Management > Add NSS Account*.

. When you're prompted, select *Continue* to be redirected to a Microsoft login page.
+
NetApp uses Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing.

. At the login page, provide your NetApp Support Site registered email address and password to perform the authentication process.
+
These actions enable BlueXP to use your NSS account for things like license downloads, software upgrade verification, and future support registrations.
+
Note the following:
+
* The NSS account must be a customer-level account (not a guest or temp account). You can have multiple customer-level NSS accounts.

* There can be only one NSS account if that account is a partner-level account. If you try to add customer-level NSS accounts and a partner-level account exists, you'll get the following error message:
+
"The NSS customer type is not allowed for this account as there are already NSS Users of different type."
+
The same is true if you have pre-existing customer-level NSS accounts and try to add a partner-level account.

* Upon successful login, NetApp will store the NSS user name. 
+
This is a system-generated ID that maps to your email. On the *NSS Management* page, you can display your email from the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/bluexp-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu.

* If you ever need to refresh your login credential tokens, there is also an *Update Credentials* option in the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/bluexp-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu. 
+
Using this option prompts you to log in again. Note that the token for these accounts expire after 90 days. A notification will be posted to alert you of this.

.What's next?

Users can now select the account when creating new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems and when registering existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

== Update NSS credentials

You'll need to update the credentials for your NSS accounts in BlueXP when either of the following happens:

* You change the credentials for the account
* The refresh token associated with your account expires after 3 months

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Select *NSS Management*.

. For the NSS account that you want to update, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Update Credentials*.
+
image:screenshot-nss-update-credentials.png[A screenshot that shows the action menu for a NetApp Support Site account which includes the ability to choose the Delete option.]

. When you're prompted, select *Continue* to be redirected to a Microsoft login page.
+
NetApp uses Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing.

. At the login page, provide your NetApp Support Site registered email address and password to perform the authentication process.

== Attach a working environment to a different NSS account

If your organization has multiple NetApp Support Site accounts, you can change which account is associated with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

This feature is only supported with NSS accounts that are configured to use Microsoft Entra ID adopted by NetApp for identity management. Before you can use this feature, you need select *Add NSS Account* or *Update Account*.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Select *NSS Management*.

. Complete the following steps to change the NSS account:

.. Expand the row for the NetApp Support Site account that the working environment is currently associated with.

.. For the working environment that you want to change the association for, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"]

.. Select *Change to a different NSS account*.
+
image:screenshot-nss-change-account.png[A screenshot that shows the action menu for a working environment that is associated with a NetApp Support Site account.]

.. Select the account and then select *Save*.

== Display the email address for an NSS account

Now that NetApp Support Site accounts use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication services, the NSS user name that displays in BlueXP is typically an identifier generated by Microsoft Entra. As a result, you might not immediately know the email address associated with that account. But BlueXP has an option to show you the associated email address.

TIP: When you go to the NSS Management page, BlueXP generates a token for each account in the table. That token includes information about the associated email address. The token is then removed when you leave the page. The information is never cached, which helps protect your privacy.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Select *NSS Management*.

. For the NSS account that you want to update, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Display Email Address*.
+
image:screenshot-nss-display-email.png[A screenshot that shows the action menu for a NetApp Support Site account which includes the ability to display the email address.]

.Result

BlueXP displays the NetApp Support Site user name and the associated email address. You can use the copy button to copy the email address.

== Remove an NSS account

Delete any of the NSS accounts that you no longer want to use with BlueXP.

Note that you can't delete an account that is currently associated with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment. You first need to <<Attach a working environment to a different NSS account,attach those working environments to a different NSS account>>.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Select *NSS Management*.

. For the NSS account that you want to delete, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Delete*.
+
image:screenshot-nss-delete.png[A screenshot that shows the action menu for a NetApp Support Site account which includes the ability to choose the Delete option.]

. Select *Delete* to confirm.
