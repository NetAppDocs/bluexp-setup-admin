Provide the credentials for your NetApp Support Site (NSS) accounts to register for support, enable key workflows for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, and more.

== Overview

BlueXP supports associating one NSS account with each BlueXP user and associating one or more NSS accounts with your BlueXP account.

=== NSS credentials per BlueXP user

Your individual NSS credentials are required to access your Digital Advisor account and to manage support cases through BlueXP. These credentials are only visible to the person logging in to BlueXP. The credentials can be removed and updated as needed.

<<Manage NSS credentials per BlueXP user,Learn how to manage NSS credentials per BlueXP user>>.

=== NSS credentials for your BlueXP account

Associating NetApp Support Site credentials with your specific BlueXP account ID is required to enable the following tasks in BlueXP:

* Registering for support

* Creating support cases

* Deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP when you bring your own license (BYOL)
+
Providing your NSS account is required so that BlueXP can upload your license key and to enable the subscription for the term that you purchased. This includes automatic updates for term renewals.

* Registering pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems
+
Providing your NSS account is required to activate support for your system and to gain access to NetApp technical support resources.

* Upgrading Cloud Volumes ONTAP software to the latest release

These credentials are associated with your specific BlueXP account ID. Users who belong to the BlueXP account can access these credentials from *Support > NSS Management*.

<<Manage NSS credentials for your BlueXP account,Learn how to manage NSS credentials for your BlueXP account>>.

== Manage NSS credentials for your BlueXP login

The NSS credentials associated with your BlueXP login enables access to Digital Advisor and case management capabilities.

* When you access Digital Advisor in BlueXP, you're prompted to log in to Digital Advisor by entering your NSS credentials. After you enter your NSS credentials, you'll see this NSS account listed at the top of the NSS Management page. You can then manage those credentials as needed.

* When you access *Support > Case Management*, you're prompted to enter your NSS credentials, if you haven't already done so. This page shows you the support cases associated with your NSS account and with your company. 

Note the following about this NSS account:

* The account is managed at the user level, which means it isn't viewable by other users who log in.
* The account can't be used with any other BlueXP feature: not with Cloud Volumes ONTAP creation, licensing, or support case creation.
* There can be only one NSS account associated with Digital Advisor and case management, per user.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.
+
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/screenshot-help-support.png[A screenshot of the Help menu where Support is the first option listed]

. Click *NSS Management*.

. Under *Your NSS Credentials*, click *Action* and choose any of the following options:

* *Associate NSS user*: Add credentials for a NetApp Support Site account.
* *Update existing credentials*: Update the credentials for your NetApp Support Site account.
* *Delete*: Remove the account associated with your BlueXP user account.

.Result

BlueXP updates your NSS credentials. The changes will be reflected when you access Digital Advisor or the Case Management page.

== Manage NSS credentials for your BlueXP account

Manage the NSS credentials associated with your BlueXP account so that you can register for support, create support cases, and enable key workflows for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

=== Add an NSS account

The Support Dashboard enables you to add and manage your NetApp Support Site accounts for use with BlueXP at the BlueXP account level.

* If you have a customer-level account, you can add one or more NSS accounts.

* If you have a partner or reseller account, you can add one or more NSS accounts, but they can't be added alongside customer-level accounts.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.
+
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/screenshot-help-support.png[A screenshot of the Help menu where Support is the first option listed]

. Click *NSS Management > Add NSS Account*.

. When you're prompted, click *Continue* to be redirected to a Microsoft login page.
+
NetApp uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing.

. At the login page, provide your NetApp Support Site registered email address and password to perform the authentication process.
+
These actions enable BlueXP to use your NSS account for things like license downloads, software upgrade verification, and future support registrations.
+
Note the following:
+
* The NSS account must be a customer-level account (not a guest or temp account). You can have multiple customer-level NSS accounts.

* There can be only one NSS account if that account is a partner-level account. If you try to add customer-level NSS accounts and a partner-level account exists, you'll get the following error message:
+
"The NSS customer type is not allowed for this account as there are already NSS Users of different type."
+
The same is true if you have pre-existing customer-level NSS accounts and try to add a partner-level account.

* Upon successful login, NetApp will store the NSS user name. 
+
This is a system-generated ID that maps to your email. On the *NSS Management* page, you can display your email from the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu.

* If you ever need to refresh your login credential tokens, there is also an *Update Credentials* option in the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu. 
+
Using this option prompts you to log in again. Note that the token for these accounts expire after 90 days. A notification will be posted to alert you of this.

.What's next?

Users can now select the account when creating new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, when registering existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, and when registering for support.

=== Update an NSS account for the new authentication method

Starting in November 2021, NetApp now uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing. As a result of this update, BlueXP will prompt you to update the credentials for any existing accounts that you previously added.

.Steps

. If you haven't already done so, https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Miscellaneous/FAQs_for_NetApp_adoption_of_MS_Azure_AD_B2C_for_login[create a Microsoft Azure Active Directory B2C account that will be linked to your current BlueXP account^].

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Click *NSS Management*.

. For the NSS account that you want to update, click *Update Account*.

+
NetApp uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing.

. At the login page, provide your NetApp Support Site registered email address and password to perform the authentication process.
+
After the process is complete, the account that you updated should now be listed as a _new_ account in the table. The _older_ version of the account is still listed in the table, along with any existing working environment associations.

. If existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments are attached to the older version of the account, follow the steps below to <<Attach a working environment to a different NSS account,attach those working environments to a different NSS account>>.

. Go to the older version of the NSS account, click image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Delete*.

=== Update NSS credentials

You'll need to update the credentials for your NSS accounts in BlueXP when either of the following happens:

* You change the credentials for the account
* The refresh token associated with your account expires after 3 months

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Click *NSS Management*.

. For the NSS account that you want to update, click image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Update Credentials*.
+
image:screenshot-nss-update-credentials.png[A screenshot that shows the action menu for a NetApp Support Site account which includes the ability to choose the Delete option.]

. When you're prompted, click *Continue* to be redirected to a Microsoft login page.
+
NetApp uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing.

. At the login page, provide your NetApp Support Site registered email address and password to perform the authentication process.

=== Attach a working environment to a different NSS account

If your organization has multiple NetApp Support Site accounts, you can change which account is associated with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

This feature is only supported with NSS accounts that are configured to use Microsoft Azure AD adopted by NetApp for identity management. Before you can use this feature, you need click *Add NSS Account* or *Update Account*.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Click *NSS Management*.

. Complete the following steps to change the NSS account:

.. Expand the row for the NetApp Support Site account that the working environment is currently associated with.

.. For the working environment that you want to change the association for, click image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"]

.. Select *Change to a different NSS account*.
+
image:screenshot-nss-change-account.png[A screenshot that shows the action menu for a working environment that is associated with a NetApp Support Site account.]

.. Select the account and then click *Save*.

=== Display the email address for an NSS account

Now that NetApp Support Site accounts use Microsoft Azure Active Directory for authentication services, the NSS user name that displays in BlueXP is typically an identifier generated by Azure AD. As a result, you might not immediately know the email address associated with that account. But BlueXP has an option to show you the associated email address.

TIP: When you go to the NSS Management page, BlueXP generates a token for each account in the table. That token includes information about the associated email address. The token is then removed when you leave the page. The information is never cached, which helps protect your privacy.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Click *NSS Management*.

. For the NSS account that you want to update, click image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Display Email Address*.
+
image:screenshot-nss-display-email.png[A screenshot that shows the action menu for a NetApp Support Site account which includes the ability to display the email address.]

.Result

BlueXP displays the NetApp Support Site user name and the associated email address. You can use the copy button to copy the email address.

=== Remove an NSS account

Delete any of the NSS accounts that you no longer want to use with BlueXP.

Note that you can't delete an account that is currently associated with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment. You first need to <<Attach a working environment to a different NSS account,attach those working environments to a different NSS account>>.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Click *NSS Management*.

. For the NSS account that you want to delete, click image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Delete*.
+
image:screenshot-nss-delete.png[A screenshot that shows the action menu for a NetApp Support Site account which includes the ability to choose the Delete option.]
