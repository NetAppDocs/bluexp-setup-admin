BlueXP is accessible from a web-based console. When you get started with BlueXP, your first step is to sign up or to log in using your NetApp Support Site credentials or SSO credentials from your corporate directory.

.About this task

When you access BlueXP for the first time, BlueXP enables you to sign up or log in using one of the following options:

BlueXP login::
You can sign up by creating a BlueXP login. This authentication method requires you to specify your email address and a password. After you verify your email address, you can log in and then create a BlueXP organization, if you don't already belong to one.

NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials::
If you have existing NetApp Support Site credentials, you don't need to sign up to BlueXP. You log in using your NSS credentials and then BlueXP prompts you to create a BlueXP organization, if you don't already belong to one.
+
Note that the default password experience is a one-time passcode (OTP) to the registered email address. A new OTP is generated with each sign-in attempt.

Federated connection::
You can use single sign-on to log in using credentials from your corporate directory (federated identity). The first user in your organization's account must sign up to BlueXP or log in using NSS credentials, and then set up identity federation. After that, you can add members from your corporate identity to your organization. Those users can then log in using their SSO credentials.

.Steps

. Open a web browser and go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^]

. If you have a NetApp Support Site account or if you already set up identity federation, enter the email address associated with your account directly on the *Log in* page.
+
In both of these cases, BlueXP will sign you up as part of this initial login.

. If you want to sign up by creating a BlueXP login, select *Sign up*.

.. On the *Sign up* page, enter the required information and select *Next*.
+
Note that only English characters are allowed in the sign up form.

.. Check your inbox for an email from NetApp that includes instructions to verify your email address.
+
This step is required before you can log in to BlueXP.

. After you log in, review the End User License Agreement and accept the terms.
+
If your user account doesn't already belong to an organization, you'll be prompted to create one.

. On the *Welcome* page, enter a name for your BlueXP organization.
+
An organization is the top-level element in BlueXP identity and access management (IAM). link:concept-identity-and-access-management.html[Learn about BlueXP IAM].
+
If your business already has a BlueXP organization and you want to join it, then you should close out of BlueXP and ask the owner to associate you with the organization. After the owner adds you, you can log in and you'll have access to the account. link:task-iam-manage-members-permissions#add-members[Learn how to add members to an existing organization].

. Select *Let's Start*.

.Result

You now have a BlueXP login and an organization. In most cases, the next step is to create a Connector, which connects BlueXP's services to your hybrid cloud environment.
