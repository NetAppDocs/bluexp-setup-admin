When you get started with BlueXP, your first step is to sign up. You'll be given the option to create an account, but you can skip that step if you're being invited to an existing account.

.Sign up options

BlueXP is accessible from your web browser through a SaaS-based user interface. You can sign up to BlueXP using one of the following options:

* Your existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials

* A NetApp cloud login by specifying your email address and a password

Both options support a federated connection, which enables single sign-on using credentials from your corporate directory (federated identity). You can set up a federation connection after you sign up. link:concept-federation.html[Learn how to use identity federation with BlueXP].

.Steps

. Open a web browser and go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^]

. On the *Log in* page, select *Sign up*.
+
TIP: If you're planning to use your existing NSS credentials, then you can skip the sign up page and enter your email address directly in the log in page. BlueXP will sign you up as part of this initial login.

. On the *Sign up* page, choose one of the login options:
+
* If you have an existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) account, select *Sign up with your NetApp Support Site credentials*.
+
When you use this option, your NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials are not added to BlueXP in the Support Dashboard. link:task-adding-nss-accounts.html[Learn how to add your NSS credentials to the Support Dashboard to enable key workflows].

* If you don't have an NSS account and you haven't created NetApp cloud credentials, enter the required information to create a NetApp cloud login.
+
Note that only English characters are allowed in the sign up form.

. When prompted, review the End User License Agreement and accept the terms.

. On the *Welcome* page, enter a name for your account.
+
If your business already has an account and you want to join it, then you should skip this step and ask the owner to associate you with the account. After the owner adds you, you can log in and you'll have access to the account. link:task-managing-netapp-accounts.html#adding-users[Learn how to add members to an existing account].
+
An account is the top-level element in NetApp's identity platform. It enables you to add and manage users, roles, permissions, and working environments.

.Result

You now have a BlueXP login and an account. In most cases, the next step is to create a Connector, which connects BlueXP's services to your hybrid cloud environment.
