== Set up Azure networking

Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment. For example, you need to ensure that connections are available to target networks and that outbound internet access is available.

=== VNet and subnet 

When you create the Connector, you need to specify the VNet and subnet where the Connector should reside.

=== Azure region

If you use Cloud Volumes ONTAP, the Connector should be deployed in the same Azure region as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that it manages, or in the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure#azure-cross-region-replication-pairings-for-all-geographies[Azure region pair^] for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. This requirement ensures that an Azure Private Link connection is used between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-enabling-private-link.html[Learn how Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses an Azure Private Link^]

=== Connections to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the location where you're planning to create and manage working environments.

=== Outbound internet access

The network location where you deploy the Connector must have an outbound internet connection. Outbound internet access is also required from your web browser when deploying the Connector from the BlueXP console.

==== Endpoints contacted from the BlueXP console

As you use the BlueXP web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer, it contacts several endpoints to complete data management tasks. This includes endpoints that are contacted to deploy the Connector from the BlueXP console.

link:reference-networking-saas-console.html[View the list of endpoints contacted from the BlueXP console].

==== Endpoints contacted from the Connector

The Connector requires outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints in order to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment for day-to-day operations.

== Set up Azure permissions

Set up permissions in Azure so that you can deploy the Connector with the permissions that it needs to manage your data and storage infrastructure. How you set up permissions depends on the installation option that you're planning to use.

If you deploy the Connector from the Azure Marketplace or if you manually install the Connector software on your own Linux host, you can provide permissions in the following ways:

* Option 1: Assign a custom role to the Azure VM using a system-assigned managed identity.
* Option 2: Provide BlueXP with the credentials for an Azure service principal that has the required permissions.

.Custom role
--
Note that you can create an Azure custom role using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. The following steps show how to create the role using the Azure CLI. If you would prefer to use a different method, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role[Azure documentation^]

.Steps 

. If you're planning to manually install the software on your own host, enable a system-assigned managed identity on the VM so that you can provide the required Azure permissions through a custom role. 
+
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm[Microsoft Azure documentation: Configure managed identities for Azure resources on a VM using the Azure portal^]

include::_include/azure-set-up-role.adoc[]

link:task-provide-permissions-azure.html[Learn how to provide these permissions to BlueXP].
--

.Service principal
--
Create and set up a service principal in Azure Active Directory and obtain the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs.

.Create an Azure Active Directory application for role-based access control

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=app]

.Assign the application to a role
 
include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=role]

.Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=api]

.Get the application ID and directory ID for the application

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=ids]

.Create a client secret

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tags=secret]

.Result

Your service principal is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you add an Azure account.

== Create a Connector in Azure

Create a Connector directly from the BlueXP web-based console, from the Azure Marketplace, or by installing the software on your own Linux host.

.Steps

. Go to the NetApp Connector VM page in the Azure Marketplace.
+
https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manager[Azure Marketplace page for commercial regions^]

. Click *Get it now* and then click *Continue*.

. From the Azure portal, click *Create* and follow the steps to configure the virtual machine.
+
Note the following as you configure the VM:

* *VM size*: Choose a VM size that meets CPU and RAM requirements. We recommend DS3 v2.

* *Disks*: The Connector can perform optimally with either HDD or SSD disks.

* *Network security group*: The Connector requires inbound connections using SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
+
link:reference-ports-azure.html[View security group rules for Azure].

* *Identity*: Under *Management*, select *Enable system assigned managed identity*.
+
This setting is important because a managed identity allows the Connector virtual machine to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without providing any credentials. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[Learn more about managed identities for Azure resources^].

. On the *Review + create* page, review your selections and click *Create* to start the deployment.
+
Azure deploys the virtual machine with the specified settings. The virtual machine and Connector software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector virtual machine and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:
.. Specify the BlueXP account to associate with the Connector.
.. Enter a name for the system.
.. Under *Are you running in a secured environment?* keep restricted mode disabled.
+
You should keep restricted mode disabled because these steps describe how to use BlueXP in standard mode. You should enable restricted mode only if you have a secure environment and want to disconnect this account from BlueXP backend services. If that's the case, link:task-quick-start-restricted-mode.html[follow steps to get started with BlueXP in restricted mode].
.. Click *Let's start*.

The Connector is now installed and is set up with your BlueXP account.

.What's next?

link:task-provide-permissions-azure.html[Provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously setup].

== Provide Azure permissions to BlueXP

If you created the Connector from the Azure Marketplace or manually installed the software, you need to provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously set up. Providing the permissions enables BlueXP to manage your data and storage infrastructure in Azure.

link:task-set-up-permissions-azure.html[Learn how to set up these permissions].

These steps don't apply if you deployed the Connector directly from BlueXP because BlueXP assigns the required permissions during deployment.

.What's next?

Go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] to start using the Connector with BlueXP.
--

.Service principal
--
.Steps

include::_include/azure-provide-permissions-service-principal.adoc[]

.Result

BlueXP now has the permissions that it needs to perform actions in Azure on your behalf.
