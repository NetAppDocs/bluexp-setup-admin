A Cloud Manager Account Admin needs to deploy a _Connector_ before you can use most Cloud Manager features. link:concept-connectors.html[Learn when a Connector is required]. The Connector enables Cloud Manager to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

This page describes how to create a Connector in Google Cloud directly from Cloud Manager. link:concept-connectors.html#how-to-create-a-connector[Learn about other ways to deploy a Connector].

These steps must be completed by a user who has the Account Admin role. A Workspace Admin can't create a Connector.

TIP: When you create your first Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, Cloud Manager will prompt you to create a Connector if you don't have one yet.

== Set up permissions to deploy the Connector

Before you can deploy a Connector, you need to ensure that your Google Cloud account has the correct permissions.

.Steps

. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#iam-custom-roles-create-gcloud[Create a custom role^] that includes the following permissions:
+
[source,yaml]
title: Connector deployment policy
description: Permissions for the user who deploys the Connector from Cloud Manager
stage: GA
includedPermissions:
- compute.disks.create
- compute.disks.get
- compute.disks.list
- compute.disks.setLabels
- compute.disks.use
- compute.firewalls.create
- compute.firewalls.delete
- compute.firewalls.get

- deploymentmanager.typeProviders.list
- deploymentmanager.types.get
- deploymentmanager.types.list
- resourcemanager.projects.get
- compute.instances.setServiceAccount
- iam.serviceAccounts.list

. Attach the custom role to the user who will deploy the Connector from Cloud Manager.

.Result

The Google Cloud user now has the permissions required to create the Connector.

== Set up a service account for the Connector

A service account is required to provide the Connector with the permission that it needs to manage resources in Google Cloud. You'll associate this service account with the Connector VM when you create it.

The permissions for the service account are different than the permissions that you set up in the previous section.

. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Create a Google Cloud service account and apply the custom role that you just created^].

. If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in other projects, https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#granting-console[grant access by adding the service account with the Cloud Manager role to that project^]. You'll need to repeat this step for each project.

.Result

The service account for the Connector VM is set up.

== Shared VPC permissions

If you are using a shared VPC to deploy resources into a service project, then the following permissions are required. This table is for reference and your environment should reflect the permissions table when IAM configuration is complete.

* (Default) Editor
a|
* compute.networkUser
| Deploys Google Cloud instances and compute infrastructure on behalf of deployment. Allows Cloud Manager to use the shared network.

|===

Notes:

. deploymentmanager.editor is only required at the host project if you are not passing firewall rules to the deployment and are choosing to let Cloud Manager create them for you. Cloud Manager will create a deployment in the host project which contains the VPC0 firewall rule if no rule is specified.

. firewall.create and firewall.delete are only required if you are not passing firewall rules to the deployment and are choosing to let Cloud Manager create them for you. These permissions reside in the Cloud Manager service account .yaml file. If you are deploying an HA pair using a shared VPC, these permissions will be used to create the firewall rules for VPC1, 2 and 3. For all other deployments, these permissions will also be used to create rules for VPC0.

. For data tiering, the tiering service account must have the serviceAccount.user role on the service account, not just at the project level. Currently if you assign serviceAccount.user at the project level, the permissions don't show when you query the service account with getIAMPolicy.

== Enabling Google Cloud APIs

Several APIs are required to deploy the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.Step

. https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis[Enable the following Google Cloud APIs in your project^].
+
* Cloud Deployment Manager V2 API
* Cloud Logging API
* Cloud Resource Manager API
* Compute Engine API
* Identity and Access Management (IAM) API

== Creating a Connector in Google Cloud

Create a Connector in Google Cloud directly from the Cloud Manager user interface or by using gcloud.

.What you'll need

* The required permissions for your Google Cloud account, as described in the first section of this page.

* A Google Cloud project.

* A service account that has the required permissions to create and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP, as described in the first section of this page.

* A VPC and subnet in your Google Cloud region of choice.

. If you're creating your first Working Environment, click *Add Working Environment* and follow the prompts. Otherwise, click the *Connector* drop-down and select *Add Connector*.
+
image:screenshot_connector_add.gif[A screenshot that shows the Connector icon in the header and the Add Connector action.]

. Choose *Google Cloud Platform* as your cloud provider.
+
Remember that the Connector must have a network connection to the type of working environment that you're creating and the services that you're planning to enable.
+
link:reference-networking-cloud-manager.html[Learn more about networking requirements for the Connector].

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the Connector:

* *Get Ready*: Review what you'll need.

* If you're prompted, log in to your Google account, which should have the required permissions to create the virtual machine instance.
+
The form is owned and hosted by Google. Your credentials are not provided to NetApp.

* *Basic Settings*: Enter a name for the virtual machine instance, specify tags, select a project, and then select the service account that has the required permissions (refer to the section above for details).

* *Location*: Specify a region, zone, VPC, and subnet for the instance.

* *Network*: Choose whether to enable a public IP address and optionally specify a proxy configuration.

* *Firewall Policy*: Choose whether to create a new firewall policy or whether to select an existing firewall policy that allows inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access.
+
NOTE: There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it. HTTP and HTTPS provide access to the link:concept-connectors.html#the-local-user-interface[local UI], which you'll use in rare circumstances. SSH is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting.

* *Review*: Review your selections to verify that your set up is correct.

. Click *Add*.
+
The instance should be ready in about 7 minutes. You should stay on the page until the process is complete.

.gcloud
--

. Log in to the gcloud SDK using your preferred methodology.
+
In our examples, we'll use a local shell with the gcloud SDK installed, but you could use the native Google Cloud Shell in the Google Cloud console.
+
For more information about the Google Cloud SDK, visit the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk[Google Cloud SDK documentation page^].

. Verify that you are logged in as a user who has the required permissions that are defined in the section above:
+
[source,bash]
gcloud auth list

+
The output should show the following where the * user account is the desired user account to be logged in as:
+
----
Credentialed Accounts
ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
     some_user_account@domain.com
*    desired_user_account@domain.com
To set the active account, run:
 $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
Updates are available for some Cloud SDK components. To install them,
please run:
$ gcloud components update
----

. Run the `gcloud compute instances create` command:
+
[source,bash]
gcloud compute instances create <instance-name>
  --machine-type=n1-standard-4
  --image-project=netapp-cloudmanager
  --image-family=cloudmanager
  --scopes=cloud-platform
  --project=<project>
  --service-account=<<service-account>
  --zone=<zone>
  --no-address
  --tags <network-tag>
  --network <network-path>
  --subnet <subnet-path>
  --boot-disk-kms-key <kms-key-path>

+
instance-name:: The desired instance name for the VM instance.
project:: (Optional) The project where you want to deploy the VM.
service-account:: The service account specified in the output from step 2.
zone:: The zone where you want to deploy the VM
no-address:: (Optional) No external IP address is used (you need a cloud NAT or proxy to route traffic to the public internet)
network-tag:: (Optional) Add network tagging to link a firewall rule using tags to the Connector instance
network-path:: (Optional) Add the name of the network to deploy the Connector into (for a Shared VPC, you need the full path)
subnet-path:: (Optional) Add the name of the subnet to deploy the Connector into (for a Shared VPC, you need the full path)
kms-key-path:: (Optional) Add a KMS key to encrypt the Connector's disks (IAM permissions also need to be applied)

+
For more information about these flags, visit the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create[Google Cloud compute SDK documentation^].

+
Running the command deploys the Connector using the NetApp golden image. The Connector instance and software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector instance and enter the following URL:
+
http://_ipaddress_:80

. After you log in, set up the Connector:

.. Specify the NetApp account to associate with the Connector.
+
link:concept-netapp-accounts.html[Learn about NetApp accounts].

.. Enter a name for the system.
+
image:screenshot_set_up_cloud_manager.gif[A screenshot that shows the set up Connector screen that enables you to select a NetApp account and name the system.]
--

====

// end tabbed area

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your NetApp account. Cloud Manager will automatically use this Connector when you create new working environments. But if you have more than one Connector, you'll need to link:task-managing-connectors.html[switch between them].

If you have Google Cloud Storage buckets in the same Google Cloud account where you created the Connector, you'll see a Google Cloud Storage working environment appear on the Canvas automatically. link:task-viewing-gcp-storage.html[Learn more about what you can do with this working environment].

== Open port 3128 for AutoSupport messages

If you plan to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in a subnet where an outbound internet connection won't be available, then Cloud Manager automatically configures Cloud Volumes ONTAP to use the Connector as a proxy server.

The only requirement is to ensure that the Connector's security group allows _inbound_ connections over port 3128. You'll need to open this port after you deploy the Connector.

If you use the default security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then no changes are needed to its security group. But if you plan to define strict outbound rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you'll also need to ensure that the Cloud Volumes ONTAP security group allows _outbound_ connections over port 3128.
