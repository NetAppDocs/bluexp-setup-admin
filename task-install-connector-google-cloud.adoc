.Steps

. Log in to the gcloud SDK using your preferred methodology.
+
In our examples, we'll use a local shell with the gcloud SDK installed, but you could use the native Google Cloud Shell in the Google Cloud console.
+
For more information about the Google Cloud SDK, visit the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk[Google Cloud SDK documentation page^].

. Verify that you are logged in as a user who has the required permissions that are defined in the section above:
+
[source,bash]
gcloud auth list

+
The output should show the following where the * user account is the desired user account to be logged in as:
+
----
Credentialed Accounts
ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
     some_user_account@domain.com
*    desired_user_account@domain.com
To set the active account, run:
 $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
Updates are available for some Cloud SDK components. To install them,
please run:
$ gcloud components update
----

. Run the `gcloud compute instances create` command:
+
[source,bash]
gcloud compute instances create <instance-name>
  --machine-type=n2-standard-4
  --image-project=netapp-cloudmanager
  --image-family=cloudmanager
  --scopes=cloud-platform
  --project=<project>
  --service-account=<service-account>
  --zone=<zone>
  --no-address
  --tags <network-tag>
  --network <network-path>
  --subnet <subnet-path>
  --boot-disk-kms-key <kms-key-path>

+
instance-name:: The desired instance name for the VM instance.
project:: (Optional) The project where you want to deploy the VM.
service-account:: The service account specified in the output from step 2.
zone:: The zone where you want to deploy the VM
no-address:: (Optional) No external IP address is used (you need a cloud NAT or proxy to route traffic to the public internet)
network-tag:: (Optional) Add network tagging to link a firewall rule using tags to the Connector instance
network-path:: (Optional) Add the name of the network to deploy the Connector into (for a Shared VPC, you need the full path)
subnet-path:: (Optional) Add the name of the subnet to deploy the Connector into (for a Shared VPC, you need the full path)
kms-key-path:: (Optional) Add a KMS key to encrypt the Connector's disks (IAM permissions also need to be applied)

+
For more information about these flags, visit the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create[Google Cloud compute SDK documentation^].

+
Running the command deploys the Connector using the NetApp golden image. The Connector instance and software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector instance and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:

.. Specify the BlueXP account to associate with the Connector.
+
link:concept-netapp-accounts.html[Learn about BlueXP accounts].

.. Enter a name for the system.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your BlueXP account.

Open a web browser and go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] to start using the Connector with BlueXP.
--

.Manual install
--
.What you'll need

* Root privileges to install the Connector.

* Details about a proxy server, if a proxy is required for internet access from the Connector.
+
You have the option to configure a proxy server after installation but doing so requires restarting the Connector.

* A CA-signed certificate, if the proxy server uses HTTPS or if the proxy is an intercepting proxy.

.About this task

* The installation installs the AWS command line tools (awscli) to enable recovery procedures from NetApp support.
+
If you receive a message that installing the awscli failed, you can safely ignore the message. The Connector can operate successfully without the tools.

* The installer that is available on the NetApp Support Site might be an earlier version. After installation, the Connector automatically updates itself if a new version is available.

.Steps

. Verify that docker is enabled and running.
+
[source,cli]
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker

. If the _http_proxy_ or _https_proxy_ system variables are set on the host, remove them:
+
[source,cli]
unset http_proxy
unset https_proxy
+
If you don't remove these system variables, the installation will fail.

. Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], and then copy it to the Linux host.
+
You should download the "online" Connector installer that's meant for use in your network or in the cloud. A separate "offline" installer is available for the Connector, but it's only supported with private mode deployments.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x OnCommandCloudManager-<version>

+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

. Run the installation script.
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-<version> --proxy <HTTP or HTTPS proxy server> --cacert <path and file name of a CA-signed certificate>
+
The --proxy and --cacert parameters are optional. If you have a proxy server, you will need to enter the parameter(s) as shown. The installer doesn't prompt you to provide information about a proxy.
+
Here's an example of the command using both optional parameters:
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.26 --proxy https://user:password@10.0.0.30:8080/ --cacert /tmp/cacert/certificate.cer
+
--proxy configures the Connector to use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy server using one of the following formats:
+
* \http://address:port
* \http://username:password@address:port
* \https://address:port
* \https://username:password@address:port

+
--cacert specifies a CA-signed certificate to use for HTTPS access between the Connector and the proxy server. This parameter is required only if you specify an HTTPS proxy server or if the proxy is an intercepting proxy.

. Wait for the installation to complete.
+
At the end of the installation, the Connector service (occm) restarts twice if you specified a proxy server.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector virtual machine and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:
.. Specify the BlueXP account to associate with the Connector.
.. Enter a name for the system.
.. Under *Are you running in a secured environment?* keep restricted mode disabled.
+
You should keep restricted mode disabled because these steps describe how to use BlueXP in standard mode from the SaaS website. You should enable restricted mode only if you have a secure environment and want to disconnect this account from BlueXP backend services. If that's the case, link:task-quick-start-restricted-mode.html[follow steps to get started with BlueXP in restricted mode].
.. Click *Let's start*.

.Result

The Connector is now installed, has the required permissions that BlueXP needs, and is set up with your BlueXP account.

.What's next?

Go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] to start using the Connector with BlueXP.

== Add permissions to the Connector

After you manually install the Connector software on your own Linux host, you need to provide the Connector with the permissions that you previously set up.

These steps don't apply if you deployed the Connector directly from BlueXP or by using gcloud.

.Steps

. Go to the Google Cloud portal and assign the service account to the Connector VM instance.
+
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#changeserviceaccountandscopes[Google Cloud documentation: Changing the service account and access scopes for an instance^]

. If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in other projects, grant access by adding the service account with the BlueXP role to that project. You'll need to repeat this step for each project.

.Result

BlueXP now has the permissions that it needs to perform actions in Google Cloud on your behalf.
