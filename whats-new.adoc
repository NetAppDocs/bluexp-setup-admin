=== Connector 3.9.38

At this time, the 3.9.38 release is available for standard mode and restricted mode. This release includes support for IMDSv2 in AWS and an AWS permissions update.

==== Support for IMDSv2

BlueXP now supports the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) with the Connector instance and with Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances. IMDSv2 provides enhanced protection against vulnerabilities. Only IMDSv1 was previously supported. 

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/[Learn more about IMDSv2 from the AWS Security Blog^]

The Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) is enabled as follows on EC2 instances:

* For new Connector deployments from BlueXP or using https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/automate/overview.html[Terraform scripts^], IMDSv2 is enabled by default on the EC2 instance.

* If you launch a new EC2 instance in AWS and then manually install the Connector software, IMDSv2 is also enabled by default.

* For existing Connectors, IMDSv1 is still supported but you can manually configure IMDSv2 on the EC2 instance if you prefer.

* For Cloud Volumes ONTAP, IMDSv1 is enabled by default on new and existing instances. You can manually configure IMDSv2 on the EC2 instances if you prefer.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html#require-the-use-of-imdsv2-on-amazon-ec2-instances[Learn how to configure IMDSv2 on existing instances].

==== AWS permissions update

We updated the Connector policy for AWS to include the "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones" permission. This permission is required for an upcoming release. We'll update the release notes with more details when that release is available.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions-aws.html[View AWS permissions for the Connector].

=== Proxy settings and Cloud Volumes ONTAP settings

Proxy server settings for the Connector are now available from the *Manage Connectors* page (standard mode) or the *Edit Connectors* page (restricted mode and private mode).

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-configuring-proxy.html[Learn how to configure the Connector to use a proxy server].

In addition, we renamed the *Connector Settings* page to *Cloud Volumes ONTAP Settings*.

* This update also includes bug fixes.

== 30 July 2023

=== Connector 3.9.32

* You can now use the BlueXP audit service API to export audit logs.
+
The audit service records information about the operations performed by BlueXP services. This includes workspaces, Connectors used, and other telemetry data. You can use this data to determine what actions were performed, who performed them, and when they occurred.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/audit/overview.html[Learn more about using the audit service API^]
+

== 2 July 2023

=== Connector 3.9.31

* You can now discover on-premises ONTAP clusters from the *My estate* tab (previously *My Opportunities*)
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html#add-a-pre-discovered-cluster[Learn how to discover clusters from the My estate page].

* If you're using the Connector in an Azure Government region, you should ensure that the Connector can contact the following endpoint:
+
\https://occmclientinfragov.azurecr.us
+
This endpoint is required to manually install the Connector and to upgrade the Connector and its Docker components.
+
As a result of this change, a Connector in an Azure Government region no longer contacts the following endpoint:
+
\https://cloudmanagerinfraprod.azurecr.io
+
Note that this endpoint is still required for all other restricted mode configurations and for standard mode.

== 4 June 2023

=== Connector 3.9.30

* When you open a NetApp support case from the Support Dashboard, BlueXP now opens the case using the NetApp Support Site account that is associated with your BlueXP login. BlueXP previously used the NetApp Support Site account associated with the entire BlueXP account.
+
As part of this change, support registration for a BlueXP account is now done through the NetApp Support Site account that's associated with a user's BlueXP login. Previously, support registration was done through an NSS account associated with the entire BlueXP account. As a result, other BlueXP users will not see the same support registration status if they have not associated a NetApp Support Site account with their BlueXP login. If you previously registered your BlueXP account for support, then your registration status is still valid. You just need to add a user-level NSS account to see the status.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 and 8.7 are no longer supported with new Connector deployments. 
+
These versions are not supported with new deployments because Red Hat no longer supports Docker, which is required for the Connector. If you have an existing Connector running on RHEL 8.6 or 8.7, NetApp will continue to support your configuration.
+
Red Hat 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9 are still supported with new and existing Connectors.

=== Introduction of BlueXP

NetApp BlueXP extends and enhances the capabilities that were provided through Cloud Manager. BlueXP is a unified control plane that provides a hybrid multicloud experience for storage and data services across on-premises and cloud environments.

Unified management experience::
BlueXP enables you to manage all of your storage and data assets from a single interface. 
+
You can use BlueXP to create and administer cloud storage (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Azure NetApp Files), to move, protect, and analyze data, and to control many on-prem and edge storage devices.
+
https://bluexp.netapp.com[Learn more from the BlueXP website^]

New navigation menu::
In BlueXP's navigation menu, services are now organized by categories and are named according to their functionality. For example, you can access BlueXP backup and recovery from the *Protection* category.
+
image:screenshot-navigation-menu.png[A screenshot of the navigation menu in BlueXP that shows categories such as Storage and Health.]

New product integrations::
* You can now manage the Amazon S3 buckets in the AWS accounts where the Connector is installed.
* You can now manage more on-prem storage systems, such as E-Series and StorageGRID. 
* You can now use data services previously only available as a standalone service with a separate UI, such as BlueXP digital advisor (Active IQ).

== 15 July 2022

=== Policy changes

We updated the documentation by adding the Cloud Manager policies directly inside the docs. This means you can now view the required permissions for the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP right alongside the steps that describe how to set them up. These policies were previously accessible from a page on the NetApp Support Site.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-aws.html#create-an-iam-policy[Here's an example that shows the AWS IAM role permissions used to create a Connector].

We also created a page that provides links to each of the policies. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions.html[View the permissions summary for Cloud Manager].

== 3 July 2022

=== Connector 3.9.20

* We've introduced a new way to navigate to the growing list of features in the Cloud Manager interface. All the familiar Cloud Manager capabilities can now be easily found by hovering over the left panel.
+
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/bluexp-setup-admin/main/media/screenshot-navigation.png["A screenshot that shows the new left-hand navigation menu in Cloud Manager."]

* You can now configure Cloud Manager to send notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html[Learn more about monitoring operations in your account].

* Cloud Manager now supports Azure Blob storage and Google Cloud Storage as working environments, similar to Amazon S3 support.
+
After you install a Connector in Azure or Google Cloud, Cloud Manager now automatically discovers information about Azure Blob storage in your Azure subscription or the Google Cloud Storage in the project where the Connector is installed. Cloud Manager displays the object storage as a working environment that you can open to view more detailed information.
+
Here's an example of an Azure Blob working environment:
+
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/bluexp-setup-admin/main/media/screenshot-azure-blob-details.png[A screenshot that shows an Azure Blob working environment where you can view a high level overview and then detailed information about the storage accounts.]

* New AWS permissions are required for the Connector to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
+
The following permissions are now required to create an AWS spread placement group when deploying an HA pair in a single Availability Zone (AZ):
+
[source,json]
"ec2:DescribePlacementGroups",
"iam:GetRolePolicy",
+
These permissions are now required to optimize how Cloud Manager creates the placement group.
+
Be sure to provide these permissions to each set of AWS credentials that you've added to Cloud Manager. link:reference-permissions-aws.html[View the latest IAM policy for the Connector].

== 3 April 2022

=== Connector 3.9.17

* You can now create a Connector by letting Cloud Manager assume an IAM role that you set up in your environment. This authentication method is more secure than sharing an AWS access key and secret key.
+

== 28 November 2021

=== Update required for NetApp Support Site accounts

Starting in December 2021, NetApp now uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing. As a result of this update, Cloud Manager will prompt you to update the credentials for any existing NetApp Support Site accounts that you previously added.

If you haven't yet migrated your NSS account to IDaaS, you first need to migrate the account and then update your credentials in Cloud Manager.

=== Connector no longer supported as a proxy

You can no longer use the Cloud Manager Connector as a proxy server to send AutoSupport messages from Cloud Volumes ONTAP. This functionality has been removed and is no longer supported. You will need to provide AutoSupport connectivity through a NAT instance or your environment’s proxy services.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-verify-autosupport.html[Learn more about verifying AutoSupport with Cloud Volumes ONTAP^]

== 31 October 2021

=== Authentication with service principal

When you create a new Connector in Microsoft Azure, you can now authenticate with an Azure service principal, rather than with Azure account credentials.

link:task-creating-connectors-azure.html[Learn how to authenticate with an Azure service principal]. 

=== Credentials enhancement

We redesigned the Credentials page for ease of use and to match the current look and feel of the Cloud Manager interface.

== 2 September 2021

=== A new Notification Service has been added

The Notification service has been introduced so you can view the status of Cloud Manager operations that you have initiated during your current login session. You can verify whether the operation was successful, or if it failed. link:task-monitor-cm-operations.html[See how to monitor operations in your account].

== 7 July 2021

=== Enhancements to Add Connector wizard

We redesigned the *Add Connector* wizard to add new options and to make it easier to use. You can now add tags, specify a role (for AWS or Azure), upload a root certificate for a proxy server, view code for Terraform automation, view progress details, and more.

== 5 May 2021

=== Accounts in the Timeline

The Timeline in Cloud Manager now shows actions and events related to account management. The actions include things like associating users, creating workspaces, and creating Connectors. Checking the Timeline can be helpful if you need to identify who performed a specific action, or if you need to identify the status of an action.

link:task-monitor-cm-operations.html#audit-user-activity-in-your-account[Learn how to filter the Timeline to the Tenancy service].

== 11 April 2021

=== API calls directly to Cloud Manager

If you configured a proxy server, you can now enable an option to send API calls directly to Cloud Manager without going through the proxy. This option is supported with Connectors that are running in AWS or in Google Cloud.

link:task-configuring-proxy.html[Learn more about this setting].

=== Service account users

You can now create a service account user.

A service account acts as a "user" that can make authorized API calls to Cloud Manager for automation purposes. This makes it easier to manage automation because you don't need to build automation scripts based on a real person's user account who can leave the company at any time. And if you're using federation, you can create a token without generating a refresh token from the cloud.

link:task-managing-netapp-accounts.html#create-and-manage-service-accounts[Learn more about using service accounts].

=== Private previews

You can now allow private previews in your account to get access to new NetApp cloud services as they are made available as a preview in Cloud Manager.

link:task-managing-netapp-accounts.html#allow-private-previews[Learn more about this option].

=== Third-party services

You can also allow third-party services in your account to get access to third-party services that are available in Cloud Manager.

link:task-managing-netapp-accounts.html#allow-third-party-services[Learn more about this option].

== 8 March 2021

This update includes enhancements to several features and services.

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements

This release of Cloud Manager includes enhancements to the management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

==== Enhancement available in all cloud providers

Cloud Manager can now deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.9.0.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_new_990.html[Learn about the new features included in this release of Cloud Volumes ONTAP^].

==== Enhancements available in AWS

* You can now deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 in the AWS Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) environment.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-getting-started-aws-c2s.html[Learn how to get started in C2S^]

* Cloud Manager has always enabled you to encrypt Cloud Volumes ONTAP data using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Starting with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.9.0, data on EBS disks and data tiered to S3 are encrypted if you select a customer-managed CMK. Previously, only EBS data would be encrypted.
+
Note that you'll need to provide the Cloud Volumes ONTAP IAM role with access to use the CMK.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-kms.html[Learn more about setting up the AWS KMS with Cloud Volumes ONTAP^]

==== Enhancement available in Azure

You can now deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 in the Azure Department of Defense (DoD) Impact Level 6 (IL6).

==== Enhancements available in Google Cloud

* We've reduced the number of IP addresses that are required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 and later in Google Cloud. By default, one less IP address is required (we unified the intercluster LIF with the node management LIF). You also have the option to skip the creation of the SVM management LIF when using the API, which would reduce the need for an additional IP address.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/reference-networking-gcp.html[Learn more about IP address requirements in Google Cloud^]

* When you deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair in Google Cloud, you can now choose shared VPCs for VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3. Previously, only VPC-0 could be a shared VPC. This change is supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 and later.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/reference-networking-gcp.html[Learn more about Google Cloud networking requirements^]

=== Connector enhancements

* Cloud Manager now notifies Admin users through an email when a Connector isn't running.
+
Keeping your Connectors up and running helps to ensure the best management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP and other NetApp Cloud Services.

* Cloud Manager now displays a notification if you need to change the instance type for your Connector.
+
Changing the instance type ensures that you can use the new features and capabilities that you're currently missing.

=== Cloud Sync enhancements

* Cloud Sync now supports sync relationships between ONTAP S3 Storage and SMB servers:
** ONTAP S3 Storage to an SMB server
** An SMB server to ONTAP S3 Storage
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-copy-sync/reference-supported-relationships.html[View supported sync relationships^]

* Cloud Sync now enables you to unify a data broker group's configuration directly from the user interface.
+
We don't recommend changing the configuration on your own. You should consult with NetApp to understand when to change the configuration and how to change it.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-copy-sync/task-managing-data-brokers.html#set-up-a-unified-configuration[Learn more about defining a unified configuration^]

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* When tiering to Google Cloud Storage, you can apply a lifecycle rule so that the tiered data transitions from the Standard storage class to lower-cost Nearline, Coldline, or Archive storage after 30 days.

* Cloud Tiering now displays if you have any undiscovered on-prem ONTAP clusters so that you can add them to Cloud Manager to enable tiering or other services on those clusters.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-tiering/task-managing-tiering.html#discovering-additional-clusters-from-bluexp-tiering[Learn how to discover these additional clusters^]

=== Azure NetApp Files enhancements

Now you can dynamically change the service level for a volume to meet workload needs and optimize your costs. The volume is moved to the other capacity pool with no impact to the volume. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-azure-netapp-files/task-manage-volumes.html#change-the-volumes-service-level[Learn more^]

== 9 February 2021

=== Support Dashboard improvements

We've updated the Support Dashboard by enabling you to add your NetApp Support Site credentials, which registers you for support. You can also initiate a NetApp Support case directly from the dashboard. Just click the Help icon and then *Support*.
