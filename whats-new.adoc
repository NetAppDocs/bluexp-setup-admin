=== Connector 3.9.32

* You can now use the BlueXP audit service API to export audit logs.
+
The audit service records information about the operations performed by BlueXP services. This includes the originating IP addresses, workspaces, Connectors used, and other telemetry data. You can use this data to determine what actions were performed, who performed them, and when they occurred.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/audit/overview.html[Learn more about using the audit service API^]
+
Note that this link is also accessible from the BlueXP user interface on the Timeline page.

* This release of the Connector also includes Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements and on-prem ONTAP cluster enhancements.
+

== 2 July 2023

=== Connector 3.9.31

* You can now discover on-premises ONTAP clusters from the *My estate* tab (previously *My Opportunities*)
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html#add-a-pre-discovered-cluster[Learn how to discover clusters from the My estate page].

* If you're using the Connector in an Azure Government region, you should ensure that the Connector can contact the following endpoint:
+
\https://occmclientinfragov.azurecr.us
+
This endpoint is required to manually install the Connector and to upgrade the Connector and its Docker components.
+
As a result of this change, a Connector in an Azure Government region no longer contacts the following endpoint:
+
\https://cloudmanagerinfraprod.azurecr.io
+
Note that this endpoint is still required for all other restricted mode configurations and for standard mode.

== 4 June 2023

=== Connector 3.9.30

* When you open a NetApp support case from the Support Dashboard, BlueXP now opens the case using the NetApp Support Site account that is associated with your BlueXP login. BlueXP previously used the NetApp Support Site account associated with the entire BlueXP account.
+
As part of this change, support registration for a BlueXP account is now done through the NetApp Support Site account that's associated with a user's BlueXP login. Previously, support registration was done through an NSS account associated with the entire BlueXP account. As a result, other BlueXP users will not see the same support registration status if they have not associated a NetApp Support Site account with their BlueXP login. If you previously registered your BlueXP account for support, then your registration status is still valid. You just need to add a user-level NSS account to see the status.

+
You also have the option to manually install the Connector on your own Linux host that's running Ubuntu 22.04.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 and 8.7 are no longer supported with new Connector deployments. 
+
These versions are not supported with new deployments because Red Hat no longer supports Docker, which is required for the Connector. If you have an existing Connector running on RHEL 8.6 or 8.7, NetApp will continue to support your configuration.
+
Red Hat 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9 are still supported with new and existing Connectors.

* The Connector is now supported in the Qatar region in Google Cloud.

=== API calls directly to Cloud Manager

If you configured a proxy server, you can now enable an option to send API calls directly to Cloud Manager without going through the proxy. This option is supported with Connectors that are running in AWS or in Google Cloud.

=== Service account users

You can now create a service account user.

A service account acts as a "user" that can make authorized API calls to Cloud Manager for automation purposes. This makes it easier to manage automation because you don't need to build automation scripts based on a real person's user account who can leave the company at any time. And if you're using federation, you can create a token without generating a refresh token from the cloud.
