=== Create a support case for additional BlueXP services

After you register BlueXP for support, you can create a support case directly from the BlueXP web-based console. When you create the case, you need to select the service that the issue is associated with. 

Starting with this release, you can now create a support case and associate it with additional BlueXP services:

* BlueXP disaster recovery
* BlueXP ransomware protection
