To create a Connector from the Azure Marketplace, you need to set up your networking, prepare Azure permissions, and then create the Connector.

.Before you begin

You should review link:reference-limitations.html[Connector limitations].

== Step 1: Set up networking

Ensure that the network location where you plan to install the Connector supports the following requirements. Meeting these requirements enables the Connector to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.

//Azure regions
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=azure-region]

//VNet and subnet
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=vnet]

//Connections to target networks
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=networks]

//Outbound internet access
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=outbound]

//Endpoints contacted from the Connector

|===

//Proxy server
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=proxy]

//Ports
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=ports]

== Step 2: Review VM requirements

When you create the Connector, you need to choose a virtual machine type that meets the following requirements.

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=dedicated]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=cpu-ram]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=azure-vm]

== Step 3: Set up permissions

You can provide permissions in the following ways:

* Option 1: Assign a custom role to the Azure VM using a system-assigned managed identity.

* Option 2: Provide BlueXP with the credentials for an Azure service principal that has the required permissions.

.Custom role
--
Note that you can create an Azure custom role using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. The following steps show how to create the role using the Azure CLI. If you would prefer to use a different method, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role[Azure documentation^]

.Steps 

. If you're planning to manually install the software on your own host, enable a system-assigned managed identity on the VM so that you can provide the required Azure permissions through a custom role.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm[Microsoft Azure documentation: Configure managed identities for Azure resources on a VM using the Azure portal^]

include::_include/azure-set-up-role.adoc[]
--

.Service principal
--
Create and set up a service principal in Azure Active Directory and obtain the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs.

.Create an Azure Active Directory application for role-based access control

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=app]

.Assign the application to a role
 
include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=role]

.Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=api]

.Get the application ID and directory ID for the application

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=ids]

.Create a client secret

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tags=secret]

.Result

Your service principal is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you add an Azure account.

== Step 4: Create the Connector

Launch the Connector directly from the Azure Marketplace.

.About this task

Creating the Connector from the Azure Marketplace deploys a virtual machine in Azure using a default configuration. link:reference-connector-default-config.html[Learn about the default configuration for the Connector]. 

.Before you begin

You should have the following:

* An Azure subscription.

* A VNet and subnet in your Azure region of choice.

* Details about a proxy server, if your organization requires a proxy for all outgoing internet traffic:

** IP address
** Credentials
** HTTPS certificate

* An SSH public key, if you want to use that authentication method for the Connector virtual machine. The other option for the authentication method is to use a password. 
+
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux-vm-connect?tabs=Linux[Learn about connecting to a Linux VM in Azure^]

* If you don't want BlueXP to automatically create an Azure role for the Connector, then you'll need to create your own link:reference-permissions-azure.html[using the policy on this page].
+
These permissions are for the Connector instance itself. It's a different set of permissions than what you previously set up to deploy the Connector VM.

.Steps

. Go to the NetApp Connector VM page in the Azure Marketplace.
+
https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manager[Azure Marketplace page for commercial regions^]

. Select *Get it now* and then select *Continue*.

. From the Azure portal, select *Create* and follow the steps to configure the virtual machine.
+
Note the following as you configure the VM:

* *VM size*: Choose a VM size that meets CPU and RAM requirements. We recommend DS3 v2.

* *Disks*: The Connector can perform optimally with either HDD or SSD disks.

* *Network security group*: The Connector requires inbound connections using SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
+
link:reference-ports-azure.html[View security group rules for Azure].

* *Identity*: Under *Management*, select *Enable system assigned managed identity*.
+
This setting is important because a managed identity allows the Connector virtual machine to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without providing any credentials. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[Learn more about managed identities for Azure resources^].

. On the *Review + create* page, review your selections and select *Create* to start the deployment.
+
Azure deploys the virtual machine with the specified settings. The virtual machine and Connector software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector virtual machine and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:
.. Specify the BlueXP account to associate with the Connector.
.. Enter a name for the system.
.. Under *Are you running in a secured environment?* keep restricted mode disabled.
+
You should keep restricted mode disabled because these steps describe how to use BlueXP in standard mode. You should enable restricted mode only if you have a secure environment and want to disconnect this account from BlueXP backend services. If that's the case, link:task-quick-start-restricted-mode.html[follow steps to get started with BlueXP in restricted mode].
.. Select *Let's start*.

The Connector is now installed and is set up with your BlueXP account.

== Step 5: Provide permissions to BlueXP

Now that you've created the Connector, you need to provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously set up. Providing the permissions enables BlueXP to manage your data and storage infrastructure in Azure.

.What's next?

Go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] to start using the Connector with BlueXP.
--

.Service principal
--
.Steps

include::_include/azure-provide-permissions-service-principal.adoc[]

.Result

BlueXP now has the permissions that it needs to perform actions in Azure on your behalf.
