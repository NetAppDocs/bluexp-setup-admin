When you use BlueXP in restricted mode or private mode, you'll use a _BlueXP account_ to manage users. You can provide specific permissions to users in your account by selecting from the Account Admin, Workspace Admin, Compliance Viewer, and SnapCenter Admin roles.

If you're using BlueXP in standard mode, you won't have a BlueXP account. Instead, you'll have a _BlueXP organization_ that you manage using BlueXP identity and access management (IAM).
