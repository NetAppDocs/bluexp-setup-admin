If you have permissions to access multiple projects within your BlueXP organization, or if you are a member of multiple organizations, you can easily switch between projects and organizations to access the associated resources.

== Switch between projects

If your organization includes multiple projects and you have access to those projects, you can switch between them at any time.

.Before you begin

You must be on any page in the BlueXP console other than the BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) pages. You can't switch to another project when viewing any of the IAM pages.

.Steps

. At the top of BlueXP, select *Project*.
