There are a few different ways to create a Connector in Google Cloud. Directly from BlueXP is the most common way.

The following installation options are available:

* link:task-install-connector-google-bluexp-gcloud.html[Create the Connector directly from BlueXP] (this is the standard option)
+
This action launches a VM instance running Linux and the Connector software in a VPC of your choice.

* link:task-install-connector-google-bluexp-gcloud.html[Create the Connector using gcloud]
+
This action also launches a VM instance running Linux and the Connector software, but the deployment is initiated directly from Google Cloud, rather than from BlueXP.

* link:task-install-connector-google-manual.html[Download and manually install the software on your own Linux host]

The installation option that you choose impacts how you prepare for installation. This includes how you provide BlueXP with the required permissions that it needs to authenticate and manage resources in Google Cloud.
