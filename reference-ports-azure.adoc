| Protocol
| Port
| Purpose

| SSH | 22 | Provides SSH access to the Connector host
| HTTP | 80 | Provides HTTP access from client web browsers to the local user interface
| HTTPS | 443 | Provides HTTPS access from client web browsers to the local user interface, and connections from the BlueXP classification instance
| TCP | 3128 | Provides Cloud Volumes ONTAP with internet access to send AutoSupport messages to NetApp Support. You must manually open this port after deployment. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-verify-autosupport.html[Learn how the Connector is used as a proxy for AutoSupport messages^]
| TCP | 9060, 9061 | Provides the ability to enable and use BlueXP classification and BlueXP backup and recovery in Government regions.
