When you associate a member with your organization, you provide permissions at the organization, folder, or project level. To ensure that those members have permissions to access the right resources, you'll need to manage the resource hierarchy of your organization by associating resources with specific projects and folders.

A _resource_ is a working environment that BlueXP already manages or an undiscovered resource that is associated with your organization (for example, an on-premises ONTAP cluster or StorageGRID system). BlueXP is aware of undiscovered resources based on your organization's telemetry data.

== View the resources in your organization

To start managing your resource hierarchy, you should be aware of the resources that are associated with your organization.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option2.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select *Resources*.

.Result

The resources associated with your organization display in the *Resources* table.

.What's next?

To find a specific resource, you can <<find-resources,search and filter the contents of the table>>. 

After you've found the resource that you're looking for, you can complete any of the following actions:

* <<view-folders-and-projects,View the folders and projects that are associated with the resource>>
* <<associate-resource,Associate the resource with additional folders and projects>>
* <<remove-resource,Remove the resource from a folder or project>>

[#find-resources]
== Find specific resources in your organization

If you have a large number of resources in your organization, you can use the search and filter options to find a specific resource. 

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, select *Advanced Search & Filtering*.

. Use any of the available options to find the resource that you're looking for:
+
* *Search by resource name*: Enter a text string and select *Add*.
* *Platform*: Select one or more platforms, such as Amazon Web Services.
* *Resources*: Select one or more resources, such as Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
* *Organization, folder, or project*: Select the entire organization, a specific folder, or a specific project.

. Select *Search*.

.Result

The contents of the Resources table refreshes to show the resources that match your search and filter selections.

[#discover-resources]
== Discover an undiscovered resource

BlueXP automatically discovers information about resources that are associated with your organization and displays them on the *Resources* page as undiscovered resources. You can view the list of undiscovered resources and discover them one at a time so that members can manage them directly from BlueXP as working environments.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option2.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select *Resources*.

. In the *Resources* table, quickly identify all undiscovered resources by sorting the values of the *Discovered in BlueXP* column by ascending or descending order.
+
You can sort the values by selecting the arrow next to the column header. If you don't see an arrow, that means there's only one value available in the column. If the value is Yes, that means you don't have any undiscovered resources.
+

. For an undiscovered resource, select *Connect*.

. Follow the prompts to discover the resource.

.Result

BlueXP discovers the resource as a new working environment that is accessible from the BlueXP canvas.

[#view-folders-and-projects]
== View the folders and projects associated with a resource

To identify where a resource is available in your organization's hierarchy, you can view the folders and projects that are associated with that resource.

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

.Result

BlueXP displays the folders and projects that are associated with the resource.

The following example shows a resource that is associated with one project.

image:screenshot-iam-resource-details.png[A screenshot of the resource details page that shows a resource associated with a project that's directly underneath the organization.]

.What's next?

* You can <<associate-resource,associate the resource with an additional project or resource>>.
* You can <<remove-resource,remove the resource from a specific folder or project>>
* If you need to determine which organization members have access to the resource, you can link:task-iam-manage-folders-projects.html#view-associated-resources-members[view the members who have access to the folders and projects that are associated with the resource].

[#associate-resource]
== Associate a resource with folders and projects

If you want to make a resource available to another folder or project in your organization, then you'll need to create an association between the folder or project and the resource.

.About this task

* If you associate a resource with a project, that resource (working environment) is now accessible from the BlueXP canvas when viewing that project.
+
NOTE: If you have multiple Connectors, the Connector that manages the working environment must be selected to view the working environment from the BlueXP canvas. link:task-manage-multiple-connectors.html[Learn how to work with multiple Connectors].

* If you associate a resource with a folder, only users who have permissions for that folder will have access to that resource. For example, imagine the following scenario:
** Folder 1 includes project A and project B
** Resource XYZ is associated with folder 1 and project A
** An organization member has permissions for project B
** That organization member won't have access to resource XYZ

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Associate to folders or projects*.

. Select a folder or project and then select *Accept*.

. To associate an additional folder or project, select *Add folder or project* and then select the folder or project.

. Select *Associate resources*.

.Result

BlueXP associates the resource with the selected folders and projects. Members who have permissions for those folders and projects now have the ability to access the resource in BlueXP.

[#remove-resource]
== Remove a resource from a folder or project

To remove a resource from a folder or project, you need to remove the association between the folder or project and the resource. After you remove the association, organization members can no longer manage the resource from the folder or project.

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

. For the folder or project for which you want to remove the resource, select image:icon-delete.png[An icon of a garbage can]

. Confirm that you want to remove the association by selecting *Delete*.

.Result

BlueXP removes the association. Members can no longer access the resource from that folder or project.
