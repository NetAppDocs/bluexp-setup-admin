When you associate a member with your organization, you provide permissions at the organization, folder, and project level. To ensure that those organization members have permissions to access the right resources, you'll need to manage the resource hierarchy of your organization by associating resources with specific projects and folders.

A _resource_ is a working environment that BlueXP already manages or any undiscovered resources that are associated with your organization (for example, on-premises ONTAP clusters or StorageGRID systems).

== View the resources in your organization

To start managing your resource hierarchy, you can view all of the resources that are associated with your organization.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option2.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select *Resources*.

.Result

All of the resources in the organization display in the *Resources* table.

.What's next?

To find a specific resource, you can search and filter the contents of the table. After you've found the resource that you're looking for, you can view the associated folders and projects, and either associate or remove a resource from a folder or project.

== Find specific resources in your organization

If you have a large number of resources in your organization, you can use the search and filter options to find a specific resource. 

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, select *Advanced Search & Filtering*.

. Use any of the available options to find the resource that you're looking for:
+
* *Search by resource name*: Enter a text string and select *Add*.
* *Platform*: Select one or more platforms, such as Amazon Web Services.
* *Resources*: Select one or more resources, such as Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
* *Organization, folder, or project*: Select the entire organization, or a specific folder or project.

. Select *Search*.

.Result

The contents of the Resources table refreshes to show the resources that match your search and filter selections.

== View the folders and projects associated with a resource

To identify where a resource is available in your organization's hierarchy, you can view the folders and projects that are associated with that resource.

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

.Result

BlueXP displays the folders and projects that are associated with the resource.

.What's next?

If you need to determine which organization members have access to the resource, you can go to the *Organization* page to view the members who have access to a specific folder or project.

== Associate a resource with folders and projects

If you want to make a resource available to another folder or project in your organization, then you'll need to create an association between the folder or project and the resource.

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Associate resources*.
+

. Select a folder or project and then select *Accept*.

. To associate an additional folder or project, select *Add folder or project* and then select the folder or project.

. Select *Associate resources*.

.Result

BlueXP associates the resource with the selected folders and projects. Members who have permissions for those folders and projects now have the ability to access the resource in BlueXP.

== Remove a resource from a folder or project

To remove a resource from a folder or project, you need to remove the association between the folder or project and the resource. After you remove the association, organization members can no longer manage the resource from the folder or project.

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.
+

. For the folder or project for which you want to remove the resource, select 

. Confirm that you want to remove the association by selecting *Delete*.

.Result

BlueXP removes the association. Members can no longer access the resource from that folder or project.
