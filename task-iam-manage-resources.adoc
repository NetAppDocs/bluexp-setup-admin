When you use BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) to associate a member with your organization, you provide permissions at the organization, folder, or project level. To ensure that those members have permissions to access the right resources, you'll need to manage the resource hierarchy of your organization by associating resources with specific projects and folders.

A _resource_ is a working environment that BlueXP already manages or an undiscovered resource that is associated with your organization (for example, an on-premises ONTAP cluster or StorageGRID system). BlueXP is aware of undiscovered resources based on your organization's telemetry data.

== View the resources in your organization

To start managing your resource hierarchy, you should be aware of the resources that are associated with your organization.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select *Resources*.

.Result

The resources associated with your organization display in the *Resources* table.

The *Discovered in BlueXP* column identifies whether you have any resources that haven't been discovered in BlueXP yet. If there are any undiscovered resources, you can discover them from the BlueXP canvas as working environments. After you discover the resources, your organization's members can manage them from the canvas.

Learn more about discovering resources from link:task-iam-get-started.html[Get started with BlueXP IAM].

.What's next?

To find a specific resource, you can <<find-resources,search and filter the contents of the table>>. 

After you've found the resource that you're looking for, you can complete any of the following actions:

* <<view-folders-and-projects,View the folders and projects that are associated with the resource>>
* <<associate-resource,Associate the resource with additional folders and projects>>
* <<remove-resource,Remove the resource from a folder or project>>
* link:task-iam-get-started.html[Discover an undiscovered resource]

[#find-resources]
== Find specific resources in your organization

If you have a large number of resources in your organization, you can use the search and filter options to find a specific resource. 

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, select *Advanced Search & Filtering*.

. Use any of the available options to find the resource that you're looking for:
+
* *Search by resource name*: Enter a text string and select *Add*.
* *Platform*: Select one or more platforms, such as Amazon Web Services.
* *Resources*: Select one or more resources, such as Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
* *Organization, folder, or project*: Select the entire organization, a specific folder, or a specific project.

. Select *Search*.

.Result

The contents of the Resources table refreshes to show the resources that match your search and filter selections.

[#associate-resource]
== Associate a resource with folders and projects

If you want to make a resource available to another folder or project in your organization, then you'll need to create an association between the folder or project and the resource.

.Before you begin

You should understand how resource association works. link:concept-identity-and-access-management.html#resources[Learn about resources, including when to associate a resource with a folder].

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Associate to folders or projects*.

. Select a folder or project and then select *Accept*.

. To associate an additional folder or project, select *Add folder or project* and then select the folder or project.

. Select *Associate resources*.

.Result

BlueXP associates the resource with the selected folders and projects. 

* If you associated the resource with projects, members who have permissions for those projects now have the ability to access the resource in BlueXP.
* If you associated the resource with a folder, a _Folder or project admin_ can now access the resource from within BlueXP IAM. link:concept-identity-and-access-management.html#resources[Learn about associating a resource with a folder].

.After you finish

If the resource that you associated is discovered using a BlueXP Connector, then you also need to associate the Connector with the project that the resource is now associated with. Otherwise, the Connector and it's associated resource aren't accessible from the BlueXP canvas.

link:task-iam-associate-connectors.html[Learn how to associate a Connector with a folder or project].

[#view-folders-and-projects]
== View the folders and projects associated with a resource

To identify where a resource is available in your organization's hierarchy, you can view the folders and projects that are associated with that resource.

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

.Result

BlueXP displays the folders and projects that are associated with the resource.

The following example shows a resource that is associated with one project.

image:screenshot-iam-resource-details.png[A screenshot of the resource details page that shows a resource associated with a project that's directly underneath the organization.]

.What's next?

* You can <<associate-resource,associate the resource with an additional project or folder>>.
* You can <<remove-resource,remove the resource from a specific folder or project>>.
* If you need to determine which organization members have access to the resource, you can link:task-iam-manage-folders-projects.html#view-associated-resources-members[view the members who have access to the folders and projects that are associated with the resource].

[#remove-resource]
== Remove a resource from a folder or project

To remove a resource from a folder or project, you need to remove the association between the folder or project and the resource. After you remove the association, organization members can no longer manage the resource from the folder or project.

.About this task

If you want to remove a discovered resource from the entire organization, you need to remove the working environment from the BlueXP canvas.

.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

. For the folder or project for which you want to remove the resource, select image:icon-delete.png[An icon of a garbage can]

. Confirm that you want to remove the association by selecting *Delete*.

.Result

BlueXP removes the association. Members can no longer access the resource from that folder or project.
