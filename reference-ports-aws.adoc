The AWS security group for the Connector requires both inbound and outbound rules. BlueXP automatically creates this security group when you create a Connector from BlueXP. You need to set up this security group for all other installation options.

| Protocol
| Port
| Purpose

| SSH | 22 | Provides SSH access to the Connector host
| HTTP | 80 | Provides HTTP access from client web browsers to the local user interface
| HTTPS | 443 | Provides HTTPS access from client web browsers to the local user interface, and connections from the BlueXP classification instance
| TCP | 3128 | Provides Cloud Volumes ONTAP with internet access to send AutoSupport messages to NetApp Support. You must manually open this port after deployment. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-verify-autosupport.html[Learn how the Connector is used as a proxy for AutoSupport messages^]
| TCP | 9060, 9061 | Provides the ability to enable and use BlueXP classification and BlueXP backup and recovery in Government regions.

== Outbound rules

The predefined security group for the Connector opens all outbound traffic. If that is acceptable, follow the basic outbound rules. If you need more rigid rules, use the advanced outbound rules.

=== Basic outbound rules
