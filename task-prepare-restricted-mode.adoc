You should understand what's needed to get started with BlueXP in restricted mode so that you can prepare your environment.

== Understand your installation options

When you use BlueXP in restricted mode, you need to use the BlueXP user interface that's running on the Connector. You can't access BlueXP from the SaaS website.

You can deploy a Connector from the AWS Marketplace, from the Azure Marketplace, or by manually installing the Connector on your own Linux host that's running in AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

== Review host requirements

The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on.

When you deploy the Connector from the AWS or Azure Marketplace, the image includes the required OS and software components. You simply need to choose an instance type that meets CPU and RAM requirements.

Dedicated host::
The Connector is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications. The host must be a dedicated host.

Supported locations::
In restricted mode, you can only install the Connector in the cloud.

Supported operating systems::
* CentOS 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, and 8.6
+
The host must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it's not registered, the host can't access repositories to update required 3rd-party software during Connector installation.
+
The Connector is supported on English-language versions of these operating systems.

Hypervisor::
A bare metal or hosted hypervisor that is certified to run CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux is required. https://access.redhat.com/certified-hypervisors[Red Hat Solution: Which hypervisors are certified to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux?^]

Networking::
<<Prepare networking for the Connector,Refer to the section below>>.

CPU:: 4 cores or 4 vCPUs

RAM:: 14 GB

AWS EC2 instance type::
An instance type that meets the CPU and RAM requirements above. We recommend t3.xlarge.

Azure VM size::
An instance type that meets the CPU and RAM requirements above. We recommend DS3 v2.

GCP machine type::
An instance type that meets the CPU and RAM requirements above. We recommend n2-standard-4.
+
The Connector is supported in Google Cloud on a VM instance with an OS that supports https://cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/shielded-vm[Shielded VM features^]

Disk space in /opt:: 100 GiB of space must be available

Disk space in /var:: 20 GiB of space must be available

Docker Engine:: Docker Engine version 19.3.1 or later is required on the host before you install the Connector. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[View installation instructions^]

== Prepare networking for the Connector

Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. Other than having a virtual network and subnet for the Connector, you'll need to ensure that the following requirements are met.

=== Connections to target networks

The Connector must have a network connection to the location where you plan to manage storage. For example, the VPC or VNet where you plan to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP, or the data center where your on-premises ONTAP clusters reside.

=== Ports

There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it.

HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) provide access to the BlueXP console. SSH (22) is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting. Meanwhile, inbound connections over port 3128 are required if you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in a subnet where an outbound internet connection isn't available.

=== Outbound internet access for manual installs

If you plan to manually install the Connector on your own Linux host, the installer for the Connector requires access to the following URLs during the installation process:

* \https://support.netapp.com
* \https://mysupport.netapp.com
* \https://cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com/tenancy
* \https://stream.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com
* \https://cloudmanagerinfraprod.azurecr.io
* \https://production-artifacts.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com
* \https://*.blob.core.windows.net

The host might try to update operating system packages during installation. The host can contact different mirroring sites for these OS packages.

=== Outbound internet access for day-to-day operations

The network location where you deploy the Connector must have an outbound internet connection. The Connector requires outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints in order to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

== Prepare networking for accessing the BlueXP console

In restricted mode, the BlueXP user interface is accessible from the Connector. As you use the BlueXP user interface, it contacts several endpoints to complete data management tasks. The machine running the web browser must have connections to the following endpoints.

| Purpose

| \https://signin.b2c.netapp.com
| Required to update NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials or to add new NSS credentials to BlueXP.

| Your web browser connects to these endpoints for centralized user authentication through BlueXP.

| \https://widget.intercom.io
| For in-product chat that enables you to talk to NetApp cloud experts.

|===

== Prepare cloud permissions

BlueXP requires permissions from your cloud provider to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a virtual network. You need to set up permissions in your cloud provider and then associate those permission with the Connector instance.

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
Create a policy and attach it to an IAM role.

.AWS
--
.Steps

. From the IAM console, create your own policy by copying and pasting the contents of the link:reference-permissions-aws.html[IAM policy for the Connector].

. Create an IAM role with the role type Amazon EC2 and attach the policy that you created in the previous step to the role.

.Result

You now have an IAM role that you can associate with the EC2 instance after you deploy the Connector.
--

.Azure
--
.Steps

Create a custom role with the required permissions.

. Copy the contents of the link:reference-permissions-azure.html[custom role permissions for the Connector] and save them in a JSON file.

. Modify the JSON file by adding Azure subscription IDs to the assignable scope.
+
You should add the ID for each Azure subscription from which users will create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.
+
*Example*
+
[source,json]
"AssignableScopes": [
"/subscriptions/d333af45-0d07-4154-943d-c25fbzzzzzzz",
"/subscriptions/54b91999-b3e6-4599-908e-416e0zzzzzzz",
"/subscriptions/398e471c-3b42-4ae7-9b59-ce5bbzzzzzzz"

. Use the JSON file to create a custom role in Azure.
+
The following steps describe how to create the role by using Bash in Azure Cloud Shell.
+
.. Start https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview[Azure Cloud Shell^] and choose the Bash environment.

.. Upload the JSON file.
+
image:screenshot_azure_shell_upload.png[A screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell where you can choose the option to upload a file.]

.. Use the Azure CLI to create the custom role:
+
[source,azurecli]
az role definition create --role-definition Connector_Policy.json
+
You should now have a custom role called BlueXP Operator that you can assign to the Connector virtual machine.

.Result

You now have an Azure custom role that you can assign to the virtual machine after you deploy the Connector.
--

.Google Cloud
--
Create a role and apply it to a service account that you'll use for the Connector VM instance.

.Steps

. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#iam-custom-roles-create-gcloud[Create a role in Google Cloud^] that includes the permissions defined in the link:reference-permissions-gcp.html[Connector policy for Google Cloud].

. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Create a Google Cloud service account and apply the custom role that you just created^]

.Result

You now have a service account that you can assign to the VM instance after you deploy the Connector.
