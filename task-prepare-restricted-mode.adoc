Prepare your environment before you deploy BlueXP in restricted mode. For example, you need to review host requirements, prepare networking, set up permissions, and more.

== Step 1: Understand how restricted mode works

Before you get started, you should have an understanding of how BlueXP works in restricted mode.

For example, you should understand that you need to use the browser-based interface that is available locally from the BlueXP Connector that you need to install. You can't access BlueXP from the web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer.

In addition, not all BlueXP services are available.

link:concept-modes.html[Learn how restricted mode works].

== Step 2: Review installation options

In restricted mode, you can only install the Connector in the cloud. The following installation options are available:

* From the AWS Marketplace
* From the Azure Marketplace
* Manually installing the Connector on your own Linux host that's running in AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud

== Step 3: Review host requirements

The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on.

When you deploy the Connector from the AWS or Azure Marketplace, the image includes the required OS and software components. You simply need to choose an instance type that meets CPU and RAM requirements.

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=docker]

== Step 4: Prepare networking

Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. Other than having a virtual network and subnet for the Connector, you'll need to ensure that the following requirements are met.

Connections to target networks::
The Connector must have a network connection to the location where you plan to manage storage. For example, the VPC or VNet where you plan to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP, or the data center where your on-premises ONTAP clusters reside.

Prepare networking for user access to BlueXP console::
In restricted mode, the BlueXP user interface is accessible from the Connector. As you use the BlueXP user interface, it contacts a few endpoints to complete data management tasks. These endpoints are contacted from a user's computer when completing specific actions from the BlueXP console.

include::_include/endpoints-manual-install.adoc[tag=update]

Outbound internet access for day-to-day operations::
The network location where you deploy the Connector must have an outbound internet connection. The Connector requires outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints in order to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

If you're planning to create the Connector from your cloud provider's marketplace, then you'll need to implement this networking requirement after you create the Connector.

== Step: 5 Prepare cloud permissions

BlueXP requires permissions from your cloud provider to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a virtual network and to use BlueXP data services. You need to set up permissions in your cloud provider and then associate those permissions with the Connector.

To view the required steps, select the authentication option that you'd like to use for your cloud provider. 

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.AWS IAM role
--
Use an IAM role to provide the Connector with permissions.

If you're creating the Connector from the AWS Marketplace, you'll be prompted to select that IAM role when you launch the EC2 instance. 

If you're manually installing the Connector on your own Linux host, you'll need to attach the role to the EC2 instance.

.Steps

include::_include/aws-permissions.adoc[tag=policy]

include::_include/aws-permissions.adoc[tag=role]

.Result

You now have an IAM role for the Connector EC2 instance.
--

.AWS access key
--
Set up permissions and an access key for an IAM user. You'll need to provide BlueXP with the AWS access key after you install the Connector and set up BlueXP.

.Steps

include::_include/aws-permissions.adoc[tag=policy]
+
Depending on the BlueXP services that you're planning to use, you might need to create a second policy.
+
For standard regions, the permissions are spread across two policies. Two policies are required due to a maximum character size limit for managed policies in AWS. link:reference-permissions-aws.html[Learn more about IAM policies for the Connector].

include::_include/aws-permissions.adoc[tag=keys]

.Result

The account now has the required permissions.
--

.Azure role
--
Create an Azure custom role with the required permissions. You'll assign this role to the Connector VM.

Note that you can create an Azure custom role using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. The following steps show how to create the role using the Azure CLI. If you would prefer to use a different method, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role[Azure documentation^]

.Steps

. If you're planning to manually install the software on your own host, enable a system-assigned managed identity on the VM so that you can provide the required Azure permissions through a custom role.

include::_include/azure-set-up-role.adoc[]
--

.Azure service principal
--
Create and set up a service principal in Microsoft Entra ID and obtain the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs. You'll need to provide BlueXP with these credentials after you install the Connector and set up BlueXP.

.Create a Microsoft Entra application for role-based access control

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=app]

.Assign the application to a role
 
include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=role]

.Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=api]

.Get the application ID and directory ID for the application

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=ids]

.Create a client secret

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tags=secret]

.Result

Your service principal is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you add an Azure account.
