BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) enables you to associate members with your organization and assign them one or more roles across your resource hierarchy. A _role_ contains a set of permissions that enables a member to perform specific actions at a specific level of the resource hierarchy. You can associate new user accounts and service accounts, manage member roles, and more.

TIP: To ensure that you don't lose access to your BlueXP organization, it's a best practice to have two members with the Organization admin role.

== Associate new members with your organization

You can associate two types of members with your organization: a user account and a service account. A service account is typically used by an application to complete specified tasks without human intervention.

.Steps

. If the user hasn't already done so, ask them to go to the https://bluexp.netapp.com/[NetApp BlueXP website^] and sign up.
+
When the user signs up, they should complete the *Sign up* page, verify their email address, and then log in. When prompted to create an organization, the user should close out of BlueXP and let you know that they've created their user account. You can then associate the user with your existing BlueXP organization.

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select *Members*.

. Select *Associate a member*.

. Complete the steps in the dialog box to associate the member:
+
* *Entity Type*: Keep *User* selected.
* *User's email*: Enter the user's email address that is associated with the BlueXP login that they created.
* *Select an organization, folder, or project*: Choose the level of your resource hierarchy that the member should have permissions for.
+
Note that if you select a folder, the member will have permissions to all projects and folders that are associated with that folder.
* *Select a role*: Choose a role that provides the member with permissions for the resources that are associated with the organization, folder, or project that you selected.
+
** If you selected the organization, you can choose from any role other than *Folder or project admin*. 
** If you selected a folder or project, you can choose from any role other than *Organization admin*. 
+

== View organization members

There are a few ways to view details about the members of your organization:

* You can view a list of all members in the organization
* You can view the members associated with a specific project or folder
* You can view the projects or folders associated with a specific member

Note that the *Members* page shows details about three types of members:

* User accounts
* Service accounts
* Connectors

BlueXP IAM includes details about Connectors so that you can associate the Connectors with the folders and projects in your organization. For example, you might associate a Connector with another project so that members can use the Connector to discover and create resources in that project. 

link:task-iam-associate-connectors.html[Learn how to associate Connectors with folders and projects].

[#manage-permissions]
== Manage a member's permissions

A role defines the permissions assigned to a member at the organization, folder, or project level. Each organization member can have a role assigned at different levels of the organization hierarchy. It can be the same role or a different role. For example, you can assign a member role A for project 1 and role B for project 2.

TIP: A member who is assigned the Organization admin role can't be assigned any additional roles. They already have permissions across the entire organization.

=== View a member's roles

To understand which resources and permissions are available to a member, you can view the roles assigned to the member at different levels of your organization's resource hierarchy.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

=== Add a role to a member

Provide a member with additional permissions in your organization by adding roles that apply to the organization, folder, or project level.

.Steps

. From the *Members* page, navigate to a member in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Add a role*.

. Complete the steps in the dialog box to associate the member:
+
* *Select an organization, folder, or project*: Choose the level of your resource hierarchy that the member should have permissions for.
+
Note that if you select a folder, the member will have permissions to all projects and folders that are associated with that folder.
* *Select a role*: Choose a role that provides the member with permissions for the resources that are associated with the organization, folder, or project that you selected.
+
** If you selected the organization, you can choose from any role other than *Folder or project admin*.

. Select *Add new roles*.

.Result

BlueXP adds the roles. The member now has permissions for the resources in the organization, folder, or project that you selected.

=== Change a member's roles

If you need to modify a member's permissions, you can do so by changing the role that's associated at the organization, folder, or project level.

.Steps

. From the *Members* page, navigate to a member in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

. In the table, navigate to the organization, folder, or project and then select a new role.

.Result

=== Remove permissions for a folder or project

You can remove a member's permissions to a specific folder or project by removing their role.

.About this task

If a member has permissions in your organization to _only_ one folder or project, you can't remove that role. You have two choices:

* If you want the member to have permissions to another part of the resource hierarchy, you need to add that role first and then delete the existing role.

* If you don't want the member to have permissions to anything, then you can simply remove the member from your organization.

.Steps

. From the *Members* page, navigate to a member in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

. In the table, navigate to the folder or project level and then select image:icon-delete.png[An icon of a garbage can]

.Result

BlueXP removes permissions for that member at the folder or project level.

=== Change roles for multiple members in your organization

If you need to change the roles for multiple members in your organization, you can use a bulk action to complete the changes all at once.

.Steps

. From the *Organization* page, navigate to a project or folder in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Edit organization*, *Edit folder*, or *Edit project*.

. On the *Edit* page, select *Access*.

. Select all members or individually select two or more members.

. Select *Define role*.
+
image:screenshot-iam-define-role.png[A screenshot of the Access portion of the edit dialog box that enables you to choose the Define role action after selecting two or more members.]

. Select the role that you'd like to assign to the members and then select *Define*.

.Result

BlueXP updates the roles for all of the members that you selected.

== Recreate the credentials for a service account

You can recreate the credentials (client ID and client secret) for a service account at any time. You might recreate the credentials if you lost them or if your business requires that you rotate security credentials after a period of time.

.About this task

Recreating the credentials deletes the existing credentials for the service account and then creates new credentials. You will not be able to use the previous credentials.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select *Members*.

. In the *Members* table, navigate to a service account, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Recreate secrets*.

. Select *Recreate*.

. Download or copy the client ID and client secret.
+
The client secret is visible only once and is not stored anywhere by BlueXP. Copy or download the secret and store it safely.

. Select *Close*.

.Result

A new client ID and client secret are now associated with the service account.

== Remove a member from your organization

You might need to remove a member from your organization--for example, if they left your company.

.About this task

This task doesn't delete the member's BlueXP account or NetApp Support Site account. It simply removes the member and their associated permissions from your organization.

.Steps

. From the *Members* page, navigate to a member in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Delete user*.

. Confirm that you want to remove the member from your organization.

.Result

BlueXP removes the member. If that member logs in to BlueXP again, they no longer have access to your BlueXP organization.
