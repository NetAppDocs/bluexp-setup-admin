[.lead]
BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) enables you to add members to your organization and assign them one or more roles across your resource hierarchy. A _role_ contains a set of permissions that enables a member to perform specific actions at a specific level of the resource hierarchy. You can associate new user accounts and service accounts, manage member roles, and more.

TIP: To ensure that you don't lose access to your BlueXP organization, it's a best practice to have two members with the Organization admin role. 


To manage users and their permissions, you must be assigned one of the following roles: 

* Organization admin
+
Users with this role can manage all members

* Folder or project admin
+
Users with this role can manage members only of designated folder or project
 
When a _Folder or project admin_ views the *Members* page, the page displays all members in the organization. However, a member with this role can only view and manage member permissions for the folders and projects for which they have permissions. link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn more about the actions that a _Folder or project admin_ can complete].

[#add-members]
== Add members to your organization

You can add two types of members to your organization: a user account and a service account. A service account is typically used by an application to complete specified tasks without human intervention.

You can add a service account directly from BlueXP. However, users must first sign up for BlueXP account before you can be add them to an organization or assign a role.

To manage users and their permissions, you must have the *Organization admin* role or the *Folder or project admin* role. Remember that users with the *Folder or project admin* role can only manage members for the folder or projects of which they have admin permissions.

== View organization members

You can view a list of all members in your BlueXP organization. To understand which resources and permissions are available to a member, you can view the roles assigned to the member at different levels of your organization's resource hierarchy.

Here's an example of a member who is assigned the _Folder or project admin_ role for a folder, which provides permissions to the three projects in the folder.

image:screenshot-iam-member-details.png[A screenshot of the details page for a member who has permissions to a project and a folder.]

Here's another example that shows a member who has the Organization admin role, which gives the user access to all resources in the organization.

[#manage-permissions]
== Manage member roles

Organization members can be assigned roles at each level and more than one level of your resource hierarchy.You can assign members roles relevant to their responsibilities in your BlueXP organization. 
 For example, if you have seven  within your resource hierarchy representing the respective projects (working environments) within them, you can assign someone the Storage admin role for three of the projects and then assign a different member the Storage admin for the remaining projects. Another possibility would be to assign one user the Storage admin role for the entire organization. 
You can manage member roles according to the needs of your organization. 

You can unassign a role from a member, add a new role or both. A role defines the permissions assigned to a member at the organization, folder, or project level.  You can assign members roles relevant to their responsibilities in your BlueXP organization. 

Each organization member can have a role assigned at different levels of the organization hierarchy. It can be the same role or a different role. For example, you can assign a member role A for project 1 and role B for project 2.


TIP: A member who is assigned the Organization admin role can't be assigned any additional roles. They already have permissions across the entire organization.

=== Unassign a role from a member

You can remove a member's permissions to a specific folder or project by removing their role.


If a member has permissions in your organization to _only_ one folder or project, you can't remove that role. You have two choices:

* If you want the member to have permissions to another part of the resource hierarchy, you need to add that role first and then delete the existing role.

* If you don't want the member to have permissions to anything, then you should remove the member from your organization.

.Steps

. From the *Members* page, navigate to a member in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

. In the table, navigate to the folder or project level and then select image:icon-delete.png[An icon of a garbage can]



. Select *Close*.
