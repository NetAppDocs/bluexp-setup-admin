[.lead]
A Connector is NetApp software running in your cloud network or on-premises network that gives you the ability to use all BlueXP features and services. One of the available installation options is to create a Connector in AWS directly from the AWS Marketplace. To create a Connector from the AWS Marketplace, you need to set up your networking, prepare AWS permissions, review instance requirements, and then create the Connector.

.Before you begin

* You should have an link:concept-connectors.html[understanding of Connectors].
* You should review link:reference-limitations.html[Connector limitations].

== Step 1: Set up networking

Ensure that the network location where you plan to install the Connector supports the following requirements. Meeting these requirements enables the Connector to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.

//Connections to target networks
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=vpc]

//Connections to target networks
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=networks]

//Outbound internet access
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=outbound]

//Endpoints contacted from the Connector

include::_include/endpoints-connector.adoc[tag=nss-endpoints]

include::_include/endpoints-connector.adoc[tag=saas-endpoints]

include::_include/endpoints-connector.adoc[tag=upgrade-endpoints]

|===

//Proxy server
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=proxy]

//Ports
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=ports]

//NTP
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=ntp]
+
You'll need to implement this networking requirement after you create the Connector.

== Step 2: Set up AWS permissions

To prepare for a marketplace deployment, create IAM policies in AWS and attach them to an IAM role. When you create the Connector from the AWS Marketplace, you'll be prompted to select that IAM role.

.Steps

include::_include/aws-permissions.adoc[tag=policy]
+
Depending on the BlueXP services that you're planning to use, you might need to create a second policy. For standard regions, the permissions are spread across two policies. Two policies are required due to a maximum character size limit for managed policies in AWS. link:reference-permissions-aws.html[Learn more about IAM policies for the Connector].

include::_include/aws-permissions.adoc[tag=role]

.Result

You now have an IAM role that you can associate with the EC2 instance during deployment from the AWS Marketplace.

== Step 3: Review instance requirements

When you create the Connector, you need to choose an EC2 instance type that meets the following requirements.

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=cpu-ram]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=aws-ec2]

== Step 4: Create the Connector

Create the Connector directly from the AWS Marketplace.

.About this task

Creating the Connector from the AWS Marketplace deploys an EC2 instance in AWS using a default configuration. link:reference-connector-default-config.html[Learn about the default configuration for the Connector].

.Before you begin

You should have the following:

* A VPC and subnet that meets networking requirements.

* An IAM role with an attached policy that includes the required permissions for the Connector.

* Permissions to subscribe and unsubscribe from the AWS Marketplace for your IAM user.

* An understanding of CPU and RAM requirements for the instance.

* A key pair for the EC2 instance.

include::_include/aws-marketplace.adoc[]

+
AWS launches the software with the specified settings. The Connector instance and software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector virtual machine and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:
.. Specify the BlueXP account to associate with the Connector.
.. Enter a name for the system.
.. Under *Are you running in a secured environment?* keep restricted mode disabled.
+
You should keep restricted mode disabled because these steps describe how to use BlueXP in standard mode. You should enable restricted mode only if you have a secure environment and want to disconnect this account from BlueXP backend services. If that's the case, link:task-quick-start-restricted-mode.html[follow steps to get started with BlueXP in restricted mode].
.. Select *Let's start*.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your BlueXP account.

Open a web browser and go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] to start using the Connector with BlueXP.

If you have Amazon S3 buckets in the same AWS account where you created the Connector, you'll see an Amazon S3 working environment appear on the BlueXP canvas automatically. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-s3-storage/index.html[Learn how to manage S3 buckets from BlueXP^]
