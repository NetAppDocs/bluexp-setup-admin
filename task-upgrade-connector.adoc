summary: BlueXP automatically upgrades a Connector to the latest release when you use BlueXP in standard mode or restricted mode. New versions are typically released each month to introduce new features and to provide stability improvements. If you prefer, you can configure the Connector to pull image updates from a local repository instead. For private mode deployments, you always need to manually upgrade the Connector yourself.

When you use BlueXP in standard mode or restricted mode, BlueXP automatically upgrades your Connector to the latest release, as long as the Connector has outbound internet access to obtain the software update.
If you need to manually manage when the connector is upgraded, you can disable automatic upgrades for standard mode or restricted mode.

NOTE: When running BlueXP in private mode, you must always upgrade the connector yourself.



== Disable automatic upgrades

Disabling auto-upgrade for your connector consists of two steps. First, you need to ensure that your current connector is healthy and up-to-date. Then, you edit a configuration file to turn off the automatic upgrade feature.

NOTE: You can only disable automatic upgrades if you have connector version 3.9.48 or higher. 

=== Verify the health of your connector

You should verify that your connector is stable and all containers running on your connector VM are healthy and running. After you disable automatic upgrades, your connector VM stops checking for new services or upgrade packages. 

Use one of the following commands to verify your connector.

Docker:: 
+
[source,cli]
docker ps -a

Podman:: 
+
[source,cli]
podman ps -a

=== Disable auto-upgrade for the connector

You disable automatic upgrades by setting the _isUpgradeDisabled_ flag in the _com/opt/application/netapp/service-manager-2/config.json_ file. By default, this flag is set to false and your connector is automatically upgraded. You can set this flag to true to disable automatic upgrades.

To re-enable auto-upgrade, use these steps and set the _isUpgradeDisabled_ flag to false.

.Steps

. Ensure you have verified that your connector is up-to-date and healthy.

. Edit the _/opt/application/netapp/service-manager-2/config.json_ file and change the value of the _isUpgradeDisabled_ flag to true as shown near the bottom of this example.

}

. Save your file.

. Restart the service manager 2 service by running the following command:

+
[source,cli]
systemctl restart netapp-service-manager.service



== Upgrade the connector

The Connector needs to restart during the upgrade process so the web-based console will be unavailable during the upgrade.

.Steps

. Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
+
Be sure to download the offline installer for private networks without internet access.

. Copy the installer to the Linux host.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x /path/BlueXP-Connector-offline-<version>
+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

. Run the installation script:
+
[source,cli]
sudo /path/BlueXP-Connector-offline-<version>
+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

. After the upgrade is complete, you can verify the Connector's version by going to *Help > Support > Connector*.
