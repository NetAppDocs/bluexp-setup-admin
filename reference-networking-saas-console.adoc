As you use the BlueXP web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer, it contacts several endpoints when completing a few administrative tasks. Computers that access the BlueXP console should have connections to these endpoints.

These endpoints are contacted from a user's computer when completing specific actions from the BlueXP console. You should also refer to networking requirements for the Connector and for specific BlueXP services. For details, refer to the related links at the end of this page.
