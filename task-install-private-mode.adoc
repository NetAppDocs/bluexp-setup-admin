= Deploy the Connector in private mode

[.lead]
To set up BlueXP in private mode, you need to deploy a Connector and then set up BlueXP by accessing the user interface that's running on the Connector.

== Install the Connector

Download the product installer from the NetApp Support Site and then manually install the Connector on your own Linux host.

If you want to use BlueXP in the https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) environment^] then you should follow separate instructions to get started in that environment. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-getting-started-aws-c2s.html[Learn how to get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in the AWS C2S environment^]

.Required privileges

Root privileges are required to install the Connector.

.Steps

. Verify that docker is enabled and running.
+
[source,cli]
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker

. Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^]
+
Be sure to download the installer for restricted networks without internet access.

. Copy the installer to the Linux host.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x /path/cloud-manager-connector-offline-<version>
+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

. Run the installation script:
+
[source,cli]
sudo /path/cloud-manager-connector-offline-<version>
+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

.Result

The Connector software is installed. You can now set up BlueXP.

== Provide cloud permissions

Now that you've installed the Connector, you need to provide the permissions that you previously set up so that you can create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. If you installed the Connector on premises, then cloud permissions aren't needed because there's no connection from BlueXP to a cloud provider.
