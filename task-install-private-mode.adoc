[.lead]
To set up BlueXP in private mode, you need to install the Connector, set up BlueXP by accessing the user interface that's running on the Connector, and then provide cloud permissions.

== Install the Connector

Download the product installer from the NetApp Support Site and then manually install the Connector on your own Linux host.

If you want to use BlueXP in the https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) environment^] then you should follow separate instructions to get started in that environment. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-getting-started-aws-c2s.html[Learn how to get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in the AWS C2S environment^]

.Required privileges

Root privileges are required to install the Connector.

.Steps

. Verify that docker is enabled and running.
+
[source,cli]
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker

. Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^]
+
Be sure to download the installer for restricted networks without internet access.

. Copy the installer to the Linux host.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x /path/cloud-manager-connector-offline-<version>
+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

. Run the installation script:
+
[source,cli]
sudo /path/cloud-manager-connector-offline-<version>
+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

.Result

The Connector software is installed. You can now set up BlueXP.

== Set up BlueXP

When you access the BlueXP console for the first time, you'll be prompted to set up BlueXP.

.Steps

. Open a web browser and enter https://_ipaddress_ where _ipaddress_ is the IP address of the Linux host where you installed the Connector.
+
You should see the following screen.

This user account runs locally on the system. There's no connection to the auth0 service available through BlueXP.

* *Review*: Review the details, accept the license agreement, and then click *Set Up*.

. Log in to BlueXP using the admin user that you just created.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up.

When new versions of the Connector software are available, they'll be posted to the NetApp Support Site. link:task-managing-connectors.html#upgrade-the-connector-on-prem-without-internet-access[Learn how to upgrade the Connector].

.What's next?

Provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously set up.

== Provide permissions to BlueXP

If you want to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments, you'll need to provide BlueXP with the cloud permissions that you previously set up.
