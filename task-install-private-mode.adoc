Deploy the Connector in private mode so that you can use BlueXP with no outbound connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS layer. To get started, install the Connector, set up BlueXP by accessing the user interface that's running on the Connector, and then provide the cloud permissions that you previously set up.

== Install the Connector

Download the product installer from the NetApp Support Site and then manually install the Connector on your own Linux host.

If you want to use BlueXP in the https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) environment^] then you should follow separate instructions to get started in that environment. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-getting-started-aws-c2s.html[Learn how to get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in the AWS C2S environment^]
