[.lead]
To set up BlueXP in private mode, the first step is to deploy the Connector software either in the cloud or on your premises. When you use BlueXP in private mode, you need to use the BlueXP user interface that's running on the Connector. There is no connection to the BlueXP SaaS website.

== Prepare a Linux host

The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on.

Dedicated host::
The Connector is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications. The host must be a dedicated host.

Supported locations::
You can install the Connector on-premises or in the cloud.

Networking connections::
The Connector must have a network connection to the location where you plan to manage storage. For example, the VPC or VNet where you plan to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP, or the data center where your on-premises ONTAP clusters reside.
+
If you want to create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Google Cloud, then the Connector must be running in Google Cloud as well.

Ports:: There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it.
+
HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) provide access to the local UI. SSH (22) is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting.

CPU:: 4 cores or 4 vCPUs

RAM:: 14 GB

Supported operating systems::
* CentOS 7.6
* CentOS 7.7
* CentOS 7.8
* CentOS 7.9
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.8
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.9
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6
+
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux system must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it is not registered, the system cannot access repositories to update required 3rd party software during Connector installation.
+
The Connector is supported on English-language versions of these operating systems.

Hypervisor:: A bare metal or hosted hypervisor that is certified to run CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux
+
https://access.redhat.com/certified-hypervisors[Red Hat Customer Portal: Certified Guest Operating Systems^]

Disk type:: An SSD is required

Disk space in /opt:: 100 GiB of space must be available

Disk space in /var:: 20 GiB of space must be available

Docker Engine:: Docker Engine version 19 or later is required on the host before you install the Connector. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[View installation instructions^]

== Install the Connector

After you verify that you have a supported Linux host, you can obtain the Connector software and then install it.

.Required privileges

Root privileges are required to install the Connector.

.Steps

. Verify that docker is enabled and running.
+
[source,cli]
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker

. Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^]
+
Be sure to download the installer for restricted networks without internet access.

. Copy the installer to the Linux host.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x /path/cloud-manager-connector-offline-<version>
+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

. Run the installation script:
+
[source,cli]
sudo /path/cloud-manager-connector-offline-<version>
+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

.Result

The Connector software is installed. You can now set up BlueXP.

== Set up BlueXP

When you access the BlueXP console for the first time, you'll be prompted to set up BlueXP.

.Steps

. Open a web browser and enter https://_ipaddress_ where _ipaddress_ is the IP address of the Linux host where you installed the Connector.
+
You should see the following screen.
+

. Click *Set Up New BlueXP* and follow the prompts to set up the system.

* *System Details*: Enter a name for the Connector and your company name.
+

* *Create Admin User*: Create the admin user for the system.
+
This user account runs locally on the system. There's no connection to the auth0 service available through BlueXP.

* *Review*: Review the details, accept the license agreement, and then click *Set Up*.

. Log in to BlueXP using the admin user that you just created.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and you can start using the BlueXP features that are available in private mode.

When new versions of the Connector software are available, they'll be posted to the NetApp Support Site. link:task-managing-connectors.html#upgrade-the-connector-on-prem-without-internet-access[Learn how to upgrade the Connector].
