Add and manage Azure credentials so that BlueXP has the permissions that it needs to deploy and manage cloud resources in your Azure subscriptions. If you manage multiple Azure Marketplace subscriptions, you can assign each one of them to different Azure credentials from the Credentials page.

Follow the steps on this page if you need to use multiple Azure credentials or multiple Azure Marketplace subscriptions for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Overview

There are two ways to add additional Azure subscriptions and credentials in BlueXP.

. Associate additional Azure subscriptions with the Azure managed identity.

. If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP using different Azure credentials, grant Azure permissions using a service principal and add its credentials to BlueXP.

== Associate additional Azure subscriptions with a managed identity

BlueXP enables you to choose the Azure credentials and Azure subscription in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP. You can't select a different Azure subscription for the managed identity profile unless you associate the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[managed identity^] with those subscriptions.

.About this task

A managed identity is link:concept-accounts-azure.html[the initial Azure account] when you deploy a Connector from BlueXP. When you deployed the Connector, BlueXP created the BlueXP Operator role and assigned it to the Connector virtual machine.

.Steps

. Log in to the Azure portal.

. Open the *Subscriptions* service and then select the subscription in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

. Select *Access control (IAM)*.

.. Select *Add* > *Add role assignment* and then add the permissions:

* Select the *BlueXP Operator* role.
+
NOTE: BlueXP Operator is the default name provided in the Connector policy. If you chose a different name for the role, then select that name instead.

* Assign access to a *Virtual Machine*.

* Select the subscription in which the Connector virtual machine was created.

* Select the Connector virtual machine.

* Select *Save*.

. Repeat these steps for additional subscriptions.

.Result

When you create a new working environment, you should now have the ability to select from multiple Azure subscriptions for the managed identity profile.

== Add additional Azure credentials to BlueXP

When you deploy a Connector from BlueXP, BlueXP enables a system-assigned managed identity on the virtual machine that has the required permissions. BlueXP selects these Azure credentials by default when you create a new working environment for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

TIP: An initial set of credentials isn't added if you manually installed the Connector software on an existing system. link:concept-accounts-azure.html[Learn about Azure credentials and permissions].

If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP using _different_ Azure credentials, then you must grant the required permissions by creating and setting up a service principal in Microsoft Entra ID for each Azure account. You can then add the new credentials to BlueXP.

=== Grant Azure permissions using a service principal

BlueXP needs permissions to perform actions in Azure. You can grant the required permissions to an Azure account by creating and setting up a service principal in Microsoft Entra ID and by obtaining the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs.

.About this task

The following image depicts how BlueXP obtains permissions to perform operations in Azure. A service principal object, which is tied to one or more Azure subscriptions, represents BlueXP in Microsoft Entra ID and is assigned to a custom role that allows the required permissions.

image:diagram_azure_authentication.png["Conceptual image that shows BlueXP obtaining authentication and authorization from Microsoft Entra ID before it can make an API call. In Active Directory, the BlueXP role defines permissions. It is tied to one or more Azure subscriptions and a service principal object that represents the Cloud Manger application."]

.Steps

. <<Create a Microsoft Entra application>>.

. <<Assign the application to a role>>.

. <<Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions>>.

. <<Get the application ID and directory ID>>.

. <<Create a client secret>>.

==== Create a Microsoft Entra application

Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that BlueXP can use for role-based access control.

.Steps

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=app]

.Result

You've created the AD application and service principal.

==== Assign the application to a role

You must bind the service principal to one or more Azure subscriptions and assign it the custom "BlueXP Operator" role so BlueXP has permissions in Azure.

.Steps

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=role]

==== Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions

The service principal must have "Windows Azure Service Management API" permissions.

.Steps

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=api]

[[ids]]
==== Get the application ID and directory ID

When you add the Azure account to BlueXP, you need to provide the application (client) ID and the directory (tenant) ID for the application. BlueXP uses the IDs to programmatically sign in.

.Steps

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=ids]

==== Create a client secret

You need to create a client secret and then provide BlueXP with the value of the secret so BlueXP can use it to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID.

.Steps

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tags=secret]

.Result

Your service principal is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you add an Azure account.

=== Add the credentials to BlueXP

After you provide an Azure account with the required permissions, you can add the credentials for that account to BlueXP. Completing this step enables you to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP using different Azure credentials.

.Before you begin

If you just created these credentials in your cloud provider, it might take a few minutes until they are available for use. Wait a few minutes before you add the credentials to BlueXP.

.Before you begin

You need to create a Connector before you can change BlueXP settings. link:concept-connectors.html#connector-installation[Learn how to create a Connector].

.Steps

include::_include/azure-provide-permissions-service-principal.adoc[]

.Result

You can now switch to different set of credentials from the Details and Credentials page https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-otc-azure.html[when creating a new working environment^]

image:screenshot_accounts_switch_azure.gif[A screenshot that shows selecting between credentials after selecting Edit Credentials in the Details & Credentials page.]

== Manage existing credentials

Manage the Azure credentials that you've already added to BlueXP by associating a Marketplace subscription, editing credentials, and deleting them.

[[subscribe]]
=== Associate an Azure Marketplace subscription to credentials

After you add your Azure credentials to BlueXP, you can associate an Azure Marketplace subscription to those credentials. The subscription enables you to create a pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, and to use other BlueXP services.

There are two scenarios in which you might associate an Azure Marketplace subscription after you've already added the credentials to BlueXP:

* You didn't associate a subscription when you initially added the credentials to BlueXP.
* You want to change the Azure Marketplace subscription that is associated with Azure credentials. 
+
Replacing the current marketplace subscription with a new subscription changes the marketplace subscription for any existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments and all new working environments.

.Before you begin

You need to create a Connector before you can change BlueXP settings. llink:concept-connectors.html#connector-installation[Learn how to create a Connector].

.Steps

include::_include/subscribe-azure.adoc[]

=== Edit credentials

Edit your Azure credentials in BlueXP by modifying the details about your Azure service credentials. For example, you might need to update the client secret if a new secret was created for the service principal application.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.

. On the *Organization credentials* or *Account credentials* page, select the action menu for a set of credentials and then select *Edit Credentials*.

. Make the required changes and then select *Apply*.

=== Delete credentials

If you no longer need a set of credentials, you can delete them from BlueXP. You can only delete credentials that aren't associated with a working environment.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.

. On the *Organization credentials* or *Account credentials* page, select the action menu for a set of credentials and then select *Delete Credentials*.

. Select *Delete* to confirm.
