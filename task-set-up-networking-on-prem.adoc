Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment. For example, you need to ensure that connections are available to target networks and that outbound internet access is available.

== Connections to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the type of working environment that you're creating and the services that you're planning to enable.

For example, if you want to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in the cloud, then you must set up a VPN connection from your corporate network to the virtual network where you plan to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Outbound internet access

The network location where you deploy the Connector must have an outbound internet connection.

=== Endpoints contacted during manual installation

When you manually install the Connector on your own Linux host, the installer for the Connector requires access to the following URLs during the installation process:

* \https://support.netapp.com
* \https://mysupport.netapp.com
* \https://cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com/tenancy
* \https://stream.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com
* \https://cloudmanagerinfraprod.azurecr.io
* \https://production-artifacts.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com
* \https://*.blob.core.windows.net

The host might try to update operating system packages during installation. The host can contact different mirroring sites for these OS packages.

=== Endpoints contacted from the Connector

The Connector requires outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints in order to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment for day-to-day operations.

== Proxy server

If your organization requires deployment of a proxy server for all outgoing internet traffic, obtain the following information about your HTTP or HTTPS proxy:

* IP address
* Credentials
* HTTPS certificate

== Ports

There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it or if the Connector is used as a proxy for AutoSupport messages.

* HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) provide access to the local UI, which you'll use in rare circumstances.

* SSH (22) is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting. 

* Inbound connections over port 3128 are required if you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in a subnet where an outbound internet connection isn't available. If Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems don't have an outbound internet connection to send AutoSupport messages, BlueXP automatically configures those Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems to use a proxy server that's included with the Connector. The only requirement is to ensure that the Connector's security group allows inbound connections over port 3128. You'll need to open this port after you deploy the Connector.

== IP address limitation

There's a possible conflict with IP addresses in the 172 range. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-limitations.html[Learn more about this limitation].
