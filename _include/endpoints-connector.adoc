//end::upgrade-endpoints[]

//tag::upgrade-endpoints-explanation[]
//Same text is also in endpoints-manual-install
^1^ The endpoints listed in option 1 are recommended because they are more secure. Note the following about these endpoints:
+
* The endpoints listed in option 1 are supported starting with the 3.9.47 release of the Connector. There is no backwards compatibility with previous releases of the Connector.
* The Connector contacts the endpoints listed in option 2 first. If those endpoints aren't accessible, the Connector automatically contacts the endpoints listed in option 1.
* The endpoints in option 1 are not supported if you use the Connector with BlueXP backup and recovery or BlueXP ransomware protection. In this case, you can use the endpoints listed in option 2.
