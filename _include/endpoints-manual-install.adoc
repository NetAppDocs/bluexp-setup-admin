//tag::endpoint-list[]
Endpoints contacted during manual installation::
When you manually install the Connector on your own Linux host, the installer for the Connector requires access to the following URLs during the installation process:

* \https://mysupport.netapp.com
* \https://signin.b2c.netapp.com (this endpoint is the CNAME URL for \https://mysupport.netapp.com)
* \https://cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com/tenancy
* \https://stream.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com
* \https://production-artifacts.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com
* To obtain installation images, one of these two sets of endpoints:
** Option 1:
*** \https://*.blob.core.windows.net
*** \https://cloudmanagerinfraprod.azurecr.io
** Option 2:
*** \https://bluexpcloudmanagerinfraprod.eastus2.data.azurecr.io
*** \https://bluexpcloudmanagerinfraprod.azurecr.io

+
The endpoints listed for option 1 are recommended because they are more secure.
+
Note the following:
* The Connector contacts the endpoints listed in option 2 first. If those endpoints aren't accessible, the Connector automatically contacts the endpoints listed in option 1.
* The endpoints for option 1 are not supported in the following scenarios:
** If the Connector is installed in a Government region.
** If you use the Connector with BlueXP backup and recovery or BlueXP classification.
