//Same text is also in endpoints-connector
The endpoints listed in option 1 are recommended because they are more secure. Note the following about these endpoints:
** The Connector contacts the endpoints listed in option 2 first. If those endpoints aren't accessible, the Connector automatically contacts the endpoints listed in option 1.
** The endpoints in option 1 are not supported if you use the Connector with BlueXP backup and recovery or BlueXP classification.
