The endpoints listed in option 1 are recommended because they are more secure. Note the following about these endpoints:
** The endpoints listed in option 1 are supported starting with the 3.9.47 release of the Connector. There is no backwards compatibility with previous releases of the Connector.
** The Connector contacts the endpoints listed in option 2 first. If those endpoints aren't accessible, the Connector automatically contacts the endpoints listed in option 1.
** The endpoints in option 1 are not supported if you use the Connector with BlueXP backup and recovery or BlueXP ransomware protection. In this case, you can use the endpoints listed in option 2.
