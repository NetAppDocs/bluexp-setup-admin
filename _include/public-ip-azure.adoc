If you want to use a public IP address with the Connector VM in Azure, the IP address must use a Basic SKU to ensure that BlueXP uses this public IP address.

If you use a Standard SKU IP address instead, then BlueXP uses the _private_ IP address of the Connector, instead of the public IP. If the machine that you're using to access the BlueXP Console doesn't have access to that private IP address, then actions from the BlueXP Console will fail.
