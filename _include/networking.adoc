//tag::dedicated[]
Dedicated host::
The Connector is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications. The host must be a dedicated host.
//end::dedicated[]

//tag::vpc[]
VPC and subnet::
When you create the Connector, you need to specify the VPC and subnet where the Connector should reside.
//end::vpc[]

//tag::vnet[]
VNet and subnet::
When you create the Connector, you need to specify the VNet and subnet where the Connector should reside.
//end::vnet[]

//tag::networks[]
Connections to target networks::
A Connector requires a network connection to the location where you're planning to create and manage working environments. For example, the network where you plan to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems or a storage system in your on-premises environment.
//end::networks[]

//tag::outbound[]
Outbound internet access::
The network location where you deploy the Connector must have an outbound internet connection to contact specific endpoints, as described in the following sections.
//end::outbound[]

//tag::endpoints-console[]
Endpoints contacted from the BlueXP console::
As you use the BlueXP web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer, it contacts several endpoints to complete data management tasks. This includes endpoints that are contacted to deploy the Connector from the BlueXP console.

//end::endpoints-console[]

//tag::azure-region[]
Azure region::
If you use Cloud Volumes ONTAP, the Connector should be deployed in the same Azure region as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that it manages, or in the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure#azure-cross-region-replication-pairings-for-all-geographies[Azure region pair^] for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. This requirement ensures that an Azure Private Link connection is used between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts.

//end::azure-region[]

//tag::ports[]
Ports::
There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it or if the Connector is used as a proxy to send AutoSupport messages from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to NetApp Support.

* HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) provide access to the local UI, which you'll use in rare circumstances. 

* SSH (22) is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting. 

* Inbound connections over port 3128 are required if you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in a subnet where an outbound internet connection isn't available. 
+
If Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems don't have an outbound internet connection to send AutoSupport messages, BlueXP automatically configures those systems to use a proxy server that's included with the Connector. The only requirement is to ensure that the Connector's security group allows inbound connections over port 3128. You'll need to open this port after you deploy the Connector.
//end::ports[]

//tag::proxy[]
Proxy server::
If your organization requires deployment of a proxy server for all outgoing internet traffic, obtain the following information about your HTTP or HTTPS proxy. You'll need to provide this information during installation.
+
* IP address
* Credentials
* HTTPS certificate
