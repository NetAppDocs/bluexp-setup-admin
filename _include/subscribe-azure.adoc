.. If prompted, log in to your Azure account.
.. Select *Subscribe*.
.. Fill out the form and select *Subscribe*.
.. After the subscription process is complete, select *Configure account now*.

You'll be redirected to the BlueXP website.
.. From the *Subscription Assignment* page:
+
* Select the BlueXP accounts that you'd like to associate this subscription with.
* In the *Replace existing subscription* field, choose whether you'd like to automatically replace the existing subscription for one account with this new subscription.

BlueXP replaces the existing subscription for all credentials in the account with this new subscription. If a set of credentials wasn't ever associated with a subscription, then this new subscription won't be associated with those credentials.
