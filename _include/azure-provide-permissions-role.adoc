Go to the Azure portal and assign the Azure custom role to the Connector virtual machine for one or more subscriptions.

.Steps

. From the Azure Portal, open the *Subscriptions* service and select your subscription.
+
It's important to assign the role from the *Subscriptions* service because it specifies the scope of the role assignment at the subscription level. The _scope_ defines the set of resources that the access applies to. If you specify a scope at a different level (for example, at the virtual machine level), your ability to complete actions from within BlueXP will be affected.

. Select *Access control (IAM)* > *Add* > *Add role assignment*.

. In the *Role* tab, select the *BlueXP Operator* role and select *Next*.
+
NOTE: BlueXP Operator is the default name provided in the BlueXP policy. If you chose a different name for the role, then select that name instead.

. In the *Members* tab, complete the following steps:

.. Assign access to a *Managed identity*.

.. Select *Select members*, select the subscription in which the Connector virtual machine was created, under *Managed identity*, choose *Virtual machine*, and then select the Connector virtual machine.

.. Select *Select*.

.. Select *Next*.

.. Select *Review + assign*.

.. If you want to manage resources in additional Azure subscriptions, switch to that subscription and then repeat these steps.

.Result
BlueXP now has the permissions that it needs to perform actions in Azure on your behalf.
