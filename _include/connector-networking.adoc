Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. Other than having a virtual network and subnet for the Connector, you'll need to ensure that the following requirements are met.

=== Connection to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the type of working environment that you're creating and the services that you're planning to enable.

For example, if you install a Connector in your corporate network, then you must set up a VPN connection to the virtual network in which you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

=== Outbound internet access

The Connector requires outbound internet access to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

=== Proxy server

If your organization requires deployment of a proxy server for all outgoing internet traffic, obtain the following information about your HTTP or HTTPS proxy:

* IP address
* Credentials
* HTTPS certificate

=== Security group

There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it or if the Connector is used as a proxy for AutoSupport messages. HTTP and HTTPS provide access to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html#the-local-user-interface[local UI], which you'll use in rare circumstances. SSH is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting.

=== IP address limitation

There's a possible conflict with IP addresses in the 172 range. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-limitations.html[Learn more about this limitation].
