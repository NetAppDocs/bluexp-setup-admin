//tag::disk-space[]
Disk space in /opt:: 100 GiB of space must be available
+
BlueXP uses `/opt` to install the `/opt/application/netapp` directory and it's contents.

Disk space in /var:: 20 GiB of space must be available
+
BlueXP requires this space in `/var` because Docker or Podman are architected to create the containers within this directory. Specifically, they will create containers in the `/var/lib/containers/storage` directory. External mounts or symlinks do not work for this space.
//end::disk-space[]

//tag::container-req[]
Container orchestration tool:: Depending on your operating system, either Podman or Docker Engine is required before you install the Connector.
