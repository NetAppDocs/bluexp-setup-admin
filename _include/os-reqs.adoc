Notes:

* The Connector is supported on English-language versions of these operating systems.
* For RHEL, the host must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it's not registered, the host can't access repositories to update required 3rd-party software during Connector installation.

//tag::aws-ec2[]
AWS EC2 instance type::
An instance type that meets the CPU and RAM requirements above. We recommend t3.2xlarge.
//end::aws-ec2[]

//tag::aws-key-pair[]
Key pair::
When you create the Connector, you'll need to select an EC2 key pair to use with the instance.

//tag::google-machine[]
Google Cloud machine type::
An instance type that meets the CPU and RAM requirements above. We recommend n2-standard-8.

The Connector is supported in Google Cloud on a VM instance with an OS that supports https://cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/shielded-vm[Shielded VM features^]
//end::google-machine[]

//tag::disk-space[]
Disk space in /opt:: 100 GiB of space must be available
+
BlueXP uses `/opt` to install the `/opt/application/netapp` directory and it's contents.

Disk space in /var:: 20 GiB of space must be available
+
BlueXP requires this space in `/var` because Docker or Podman are architected to create the containers within this directory. Specifically, they will create containers in the `/var/lib/containers/storage` directory. External mounts or symlinks do not work for this space.
//end::disk-space[]

//tag::docker[]
Docker Engine:: 
Docker Engine is required on the host before you install the Connector. 
+
* The minimum supported version is 23.0.6.
* The maximum supported version is 26.0.0.
+
Note that Docker Engine 26 is supported with _new_ Connector installations starting with the 3.9.44 release of the Connector.

Podman on RHEL hosts::
Podman is required before you install the Connector on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host. The following prerequisites must be met for Podman:
+
* Podman version 4.6.1 or 4.9.4 is required
* The podman.socket service must be enabled and started
* python3 must be installed
* The podman-compose package version 1.0.6 must be installed
* podman-compose must be added to the PATH environment variable
