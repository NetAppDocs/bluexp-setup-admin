.Azure Marketplace
--
.What you'll need

* A VNet and subnet that meets networking requirements.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html[Learn about networking requirements]

* An Azure custom role that includes the required permissions for the Connector.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html[Learn how to set up AWS permissions]

.Steps

. Go to the NetApp Connector VM page in the Azure Marketplace.
+
* https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manager[Azure Marketplace page for commercial regions^]
* https://portal.azure.us/#create/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manageroccm-byol[Azure Marketplace page for Azure Government regions^]

. Click *Get it now* and then click *Continue*.

. From the Azure portal, click *Create* and follow the steps to configure the virtual machine.
+
Note the following as you configure the VM:

* The Connector can perform optimally with either HDD or SSD disks.

* Choose a VM size that meets CPU and RAM requirements. We recommend DS3 v2.

* For the network security group, the Connector requires inbound connections using SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html[Learn about networking requirements].

* Under *Management*, enable *System assigned managed identity* for the Connector by selecting *On*.
+
This setting is important because a managed identity allows the Connector virtual machine to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without providing any credentials. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[Learn more about managed identities for Azure resources^].

. On the *Review + create* page, review your selections and click *Create* to start the deployment.
+
Azure deploys the virtual machine with the specified settings. The virtual machine and Connector software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. After the VM is running, go to the Azure portal and assign the Azure custom role to the Connector virtual machine for one or more subscriptions:

.. Open the *Subscriptions* service and then select the subscription in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

.. Click *Access control (IAM)* > *Add* > *Add role assignment*.

.. In the *Role* tab, select the *BlueXP Operator* role and click *Next*.
+
NOTE: BlueXP Operator is the default name provided in the BlueXP policy. If you chose a different name for the role, then select that name instead.

.. In the *Members* tab, complete the following steps:

* Assign access to a *Managed identity*.

* Click *Select members*, select the subscription in which the Connector virtual machine was created, choose *Virtual machine*, and then select the Connector virtual machine.

* Click *Select*.

* Click *Next*.

.. Click *Review + assign*.

.. If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP from additional subscriptions, switch to that subscription and then repeat these steps.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and has the permissions that it needs to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.
--

.Manual install
--
.What you'll need

* Root privileges to install the Connector.

* Details about a proxy server, if a proxy is required for internet access from the Connector.
+
You have the option to configure a proxy server after installation but doing so requires restarting the Connector.

* A CA-signed certificate, if the proxy server uses HTTPS.

.About this task

* The installation installs the AWS command line tools (awscli) to enable recovery procedures from NetApp support.
+
If you receive a message that installing the awscli failed, you can safely ignore the message. The Connector can operate successfully without the tools.

* The installer that is available on the NetApp Support Site might be an earlier version. After installation, the Connector automatically updates itself if a new version is available.

.Steps

. Verify that docker is enabled and running.
+
[source,cli]
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker

. Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], and then copy it to the Linux host.
+
You should download the "online" Connector installer that's meant for use in your network or in the cloud. A separate "offline" installer is available for the Connector, but it's only supported with private mode deployments.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.23

. Run the installation script.
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.23 --proxy <HTTP or HTTPS proxy server> --cacert <path and file name of a CA-signed certificate>
+
The --proxy and --cacert parameters are optional. If you have a proxy server, you will need to enter the parameter(s) as shown. The installer doesn't prompt you to provide information about a proxy.
+
Here's an example of the command using both optional parameters:
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.23 --proxy https://user:password@10.0.0.30:8080/ --cacert /tmp/cacert/certificate.cer
+
--proxy configures the Connector to use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy server using one of the following formats:
+
* \http://address:port
* \http://username:password@address:port
* \https://address:port
* \https://username:password@address:port

+
--cacert specifies a CA-signed certificate to use for HTTPS access between the Connector and the proxy server. This parameter is required only if you specify an HTTPS proxy server.
+
The Connector is now installed. At the end of the installation, the Connector service (occm) restarts twice if you specified a proxy server.

. Provide permissions for manual installations:
+
* AWS: 
+
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#attach-iam-role[Attach the IAM role that you previously created to the Connector EC2 instance].

* Azure
+
Go to the Azure portal and assign the Azure custom role to the Connector virtual machine for one or more subscriptions:

.. Open the *Subscriptions* service and then select the subscription in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

.. Click *Access control (IAM)* > *Add* > *Add role assignment*.

.. In the *Role* tab, select the *BlueXP Operator* role and click *Next*.
+
NOTE: BlueXP Operator is the default name provided in the BlueXP policy. If you chose a different name for the role, then select that name instead.

.. In the *Members* tab, complete the following steps:

* Assign access to a *Managed identity*.

* Click *Select members*, select the subscription in which the Connector virtual machine was created, choose *Virtual machine*, and then select the Connector virtual machine.

* Click *Select*.

* Click *Next*.

.. Click *Review + assign*.

.. If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP from additional subscriptions, switch to that subscription and then repeat these steps.

* Google Cloud
+
.. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#changeserviceaccountandscopes[Associate the service account that you created with the Connector VM]

.. If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in other projects, grant access by adding the service account with the BlueXP role to that project. You’ll need to repeat this step for each project.
