.Azure Marketplace
--
.What you'll need

* A VNet and subnet that meets networking requirements.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html[Learn about networking requirements]

* An Azure custom role that includes the required permissions for the Connector.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html#prepare-cloud-permissions[Learn how to set up Azure permissions]

.Steps

. Go to the NetApp Connector VM page in the Azure Marketplace.
+
* https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manager[Azure Marketplace page for commercial regions^]
* https://portal.azure.us/#create/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manageroccm-byol[Azure Marketplace page for Azure Government regions^]

. Click *Get it now* and then click *Continue*.

. From the Azure portal, click *Create* and follow the steps to configure the virtual machine.
+
Note the following as you configure the VM:

* The Connector can perform optimally with either HDD or SSD disks.

* Choose a VM size that meets CPU and RAM requirements. We recommend DS3 v2.

* For the network security group, the Connector requires inbound connections using SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html[Learn about networking requirements].

* Under *Management*, enable *System assigned managed identity* for the Connector by selecting *On*.
+
This setting is important because a managed identity allows the Connector virtual machine to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without providing any credentials. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[Learn more about managed identities for Azure resources^].

. On the *Review + create* page, review your selections and click *Create* to start the deployment.

.Result

Azure deploys the virtual machine with the specified settings. The virtual machine and Connector software should be running in approximately five minutes.

.What's next?

Provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously set up.
--

.Manual install
--
.What you'll need

* Root privileges to install the Connector.

* Details about a proxy server, if a proxy is required for internet access from the Connector.
+
You have the option to configure a proxy server after installation but doing so requires restarting the Connector.

* A CA-signed certificate, if the proxy server uses HTTPS or if the proxy is an intercepting proxy.

.About this task

* The installation installs the AWS command line tools (awscli) to enable recovery procedures from NetApp support.
+
If you receive a message that installing the awscli failed, you can safely ignore the message. The Connector can operate successfully without the tools.

* The installer that is available on the NetApp Support Site might be an earlier version. After installation, the Connector automatically updates itself if a new version is available.

.Steps

. Verify that docker is enabled and running.
+
[source,cli]
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker

. If the _http_proxy_ or _https_proxy_ system variables are set on the host, remove them:
+
[source,cli]
unset http_proxy
unset https_proxy
+
If you don't remove these system variables, the installation will fail.

. Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], and then copy it to the Linux host.
+
You should download the "online" Connector installer that's meant for use in your network or in the cloud. A separate "offline" installer is available for the Connector, but it's only supported with private mode deployments.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x OnCommandCloudManager-<version>

+
Where <version> is the version of the Connector that you downloaded.

. Run the installation script.
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-<version> --proxy <HTTP or HTTPS proxy server> --cacert <path and file name of a CA-signed certificate>
+
The --proxy and --cacert parameters are optional. If you have a proxy server, you will need to enter the parameter(s) as shown. The installer doesn't prompt you to provide information about a proxy.
+
Here's an example of the command using both optional parameters:
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.26 --proxy https://user:password@10.0.0.30:8080/ --cacert /tmp/cacert/certificate.cer
+
--proxy configures the Connector to use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy server using one of the following formats:
+
* \http://address:port
* \http://username:password@address:port
* \https://address:port
* \https://username:password@address:port

+
--cacert specifies a CA-signed certificate to use for HTTPS access between the Connector and the proxy server. h

.Result

The Connector is now installed. At the end of the installation, the Connector service (occm) restarts twice if you specified a proxy server.

.What's next?

Set up BlueXP.

== Set up BlueXP

When you access the BlueXP console for the first time, you'll be prompted to choose an account to associate the Connector with and you'll need to enable restricted mode.

.Steps

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector instance and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. Sign up or log in to BlueXP.

. After you're logged in, set up BlueXP:

.. Enter a name for the Connector.

.. Enter a name for a new BlueXP account or select an existing account.
+
You can select an existing account if your log in is already associated with a BlueXP account.

.. Select *Are you running in a secured environment?*

.. Select *Enable restricted mode on this account*.
+
If you deployed the Connector in a Government region, the checkbox is already enabled and can't be changed. This is because restricted mode is the only mode supported in Government regions.
+
image:screenshot-restricted-mode.png["A screenshot that shows the welcome page where you need to enter a Connector name, account name, and can enable restricted mode on this account."]

.. Click *Let's start*.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your BlueXP account. All users need to access BlueXP using the IP address of the Connector instance.

.What's next?

Provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously set up.

== Provide permissions to BlueXP

If you deployed the Connector from the Azure Marketplace or if you manually installed the Connector software, you need to provide the permissions that you previously set up so that you can use BlueXP services.

These steps don't apply if you deployed the Connector from the AWS Marketplace because you chose the required IAM role during deployment.
