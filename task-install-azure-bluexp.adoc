== Deployment overview

The following steps provide a high-level summary of the tasks that you'll complete on this page. Additional details about each of these steps are available below.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Set up networking

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need to set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment. You'll need a VNet and subnet, a network connection to the locations that BlueXP needs to manage, outbound internet access, and the details about your proxy server (if one is required).

[role="quick-margin-para"]
link:task-set-up-networking-azure.html[Learn about networking requirements].

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Set up Azure permissions

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Create a custom role and then apply it to your Azure account or an Azure AD service principal. BlueXP authenticates with Azure and uses these permissions to create the Connector instance on your behalf.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Create the Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
From BlueXP, click the Connector drop-down, select *Add Connector* and follow the prompts.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
link:task-install-connector-azure.html[Follow step-by-step instructions].

== Set up networking

Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment. For example, you need to ensure that connections are available to target networks and that outbound internet access is available.

=== Azure region

If you use Cloud Volumes ONTAP, the Connector should be deployed in the same Azure region as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that it manages, or in the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure#azure-cross-region-replication-pairings-for-all-geographies[Azure region pair^] for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. This requirement ensures that an Azure Private Link connection is used between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-enabling-private-link.html[Learn how Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses an Azure Private Link^]

=== VNet and subnet 

When you create the Connector, you need to specify the VNet and subnet where the Connector should reside.

=== Connections to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the location where you're planning to create and manage working environments.

=== Outbound internet access

The network location where you deploy the Connector must have an outbound internet connection. Outbound internet access is also required from your web browser when deploying the Connector from the BlueXP console.

==== Endpoints contacted from the BlueXP console

As you use the BlueXP web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer, it contacts several endpoints to complete data management tasks. This includes endpoints that are contacted to deploy the Connector from the BlueXP console.

link:reference-networking-saas-console.html[View the list of endpoints contacted from the BlueXP console].

==== Endpoints contacted from the Connector

The Connector requires outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints in order to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment for day-to-day operations.

== Set up Azure permissions

When creating the Connector from BlueXP, you need to provide a login that enables BlueXP to authenticate with Azure and deploy the VM. You have two options:

. Sign in with your Microsoft account when prompted. This account must have specific Azure permissions. This is the default option.

. Provide details about an Azure AD service principal. This service principal also requires specific permissions.

With both options, the first step is create a custom role.

=== Create a custom role

Create a custom role that you can assign to your Azure account or to a service principal.

Note that you can create an Azure custom role using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. The following steps show how to create the role using the Azure CLI. If you would prefer to use a different method, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role[Azure documentation^]

.Steps

. Copy the required permissions for a new custom role in Azure and save them in a JSON file.
+
NOTE: This custom role contains only the permissions needed to launch the Connector VM in Azure from BlueXP. Don't use this policy for other situations. When BlueXP creates the Connector, it applies a new set of permissions to the Connector VM that enables the Connector to manage the resources in your public cloud environment.

. Modify the JSON by adding your Azure subscription ID to the assignable scope.
+
*Example*
+
[source,json]
"AssignableScopes": [
"/subscriptions/d333af45-0d07-4154-943d-c25fbzzzzzzz"
],

. Use the JSON file to create a custom role in Azure.
+
The following steps describe how to create the role by using Bash in Azure Cloud Shell.

.. Start https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview[Azure Cloud Shell^] and choose the Bash environment.

.. Upload the JSON file.
+
image:screenshot_azure_shell_upload.png[A screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell where you can choose the option to upload a file.]

.. Enter the following Azure CLI command:
+
[source,azurecli]
az role definition create --role-definition Policy_for_Setup_As_Service_Azure.json

+
You should now have a custom role called _Azure SetupAsService_. You can now apply this custom role to your user account or to a service principal.

=== Set up an authentication method

To deploy the Connector, BlueXP needs to authenticate with Azure. You can choose between two Azure authentication methods.

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Azure user account
--
Assign the custom role to the user who will deploy the Connector from BlueXP.

.Steps

. In the Azure portal, open the *Subscriptions* service and select the user's subscription.

. Click *Access control (IAM)*.

. Click *Add* > *Add role assignment* and then add the permissions:

.. Select the *Azure SetupAsService* role and click *Next*.
+
NOTE: Azure SetupAsService is the default name provided in the Connector deployment policy for Azure. If you chose a different name for the role, then select that name instead.

.. Keep *User, group, or service principal* selected.

.. Click *Select members*, choose your user account, and click *Select*.

.. Click *Next*.

.. Click *Review + assign*.

.Result

The Azure user now has the permissions required to deploy the Connector from BlueXP.
--

.Service principal
--
Rather than logging in with your Azure account, you can provide BlueXP with the credentials for an Azure service principal that has the required permissions.

Create and set up a service principal in Azure Active Directory and obtain the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs.

.Create an Azure Active Directory application for role-based access control

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=app]

.Assign the custom role to the application

. From the Azure portal, open the *Subscriptions* service.

. Select the subscription.

. Click *Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment*.

. In the *Role* tab, select the *BlueXP Operator* role and click *Next*.

. In the *Members* tab, complete the following steps:

.. Keep *User, group, or service principal* selected.
.. Click *Select members*.
+
image:screenshot-azure-service-principal-role.png[A screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Members tab when adding a role to an application.]

.. Search for the name of the application.
+
Here's an example:
+
image:screenshot_azure_service_principal_role.png[A screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Add role assignment form in the Azure portal.]

.. Select the application and click *Select*.
.. Click *Next*.

. Click *Review + assign*.
+
The service principal now has the required Azure permissions to deploy the Connector.
+
If you want to manage resources in multiple Azure subscriptions, then you must bind the service principal to each of those subscriptions. For example, BlueXP enables you to select the subscription that you want to use when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=api]

.Get the application ID and directory ID for the application

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=ids]

.Create a client secret

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=secret]

.Result

Your service principal is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you create the Connector.
--

====
// end tabbed area

== Create the Connector

Create the Connector directly from the BlueXP web-based console.

.Before you begin

You should have the following:

* An Azure subscription.

* A VNet and subnet in your Azure region of choice.

* Details about a proxy server, if your organization requires a proxy for all outgoing internet traffic:

** IP address
** Credentials
** HTTPS certificate

* An SSH public key, if you want to use that authentication method for the Connector virtual machine. The other option for the authentication method is to use a password. 
+
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux-vm-connect?tabs=Linux[Learn about connecting to a Linux VM in Azure^]

* If you don't want BlueXP to automatically create an Azure role for the Connector, then you'll need to create your own link:reference-permissions-azure.html[using the policy on this page].
+
These permissions are for the Connector instance itself. It's a different set of permissions than what you previously set up to deploy the Connector VM.

.Steps

. If you're creating your first Working Environment, click *Add Working Environment* and follow the prompts. Otherwise, click the *Connector* drop-down and select *Add Connector*.
+
image:screenshot_connector_add.gif[A screenshot that shows the Connector icon in the header and the Add Connector action.]

. Choose *Microsoft Azure* as your cloud provider.

. On the *Deploying a Connector* page:

.. Under *Authentication*, select the authentication option that matches how you set up Azure permissions:
+
* Select *Azure user account* to log in to your Microsoft account, which should have the required permissions.
+
The form is owned and hosted by Microsoft. Your credentials are not provided to NetApp.
+
TIP: If you're already logged in to an Azure account, then BlueXP will automatically use that account. If you have multiple accounts, then you might need to log out first to ensure that you're using the right account.

* Select *Active Directory service principal* to enter information about the Azure Active Directory service principal that grants the required permissions:
+
** Application (client) ID
** Directory (tenant) ID
** Client Secret

+
link:task-set-up-permissions-azure.html[Learn how to obtain these values for a service principal].

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the Connector:

* *VM Authentication*: Choose an Azure subscription, a location, a new resource group or an existing resource group, and then choose an authentication method for the Connector virtual machine that you're creating.
+
The authentication method for the virtual machine can be a password or an SSH public key.
+
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux-vm-connect?tabs=Linux[Learn about connecting to a Linux VM in Azure^]

* *Details*: Enter a name for the instance, specify tags, and choose whether you want BlueXP to create a new role that has the required permissions, or if you want to select an existing role that you set up with link:reference-permissions-azure.html[the required permissions].
+
Note that you can choose the Azure subscriptions associated with this role. Each subscription that you choose provides the Connector permissions to manage resources in that subscription (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP).

* *Network*: Choose a VNet and subnet, whether to enable a public IP address, and optionally specify a proxy configuration.

* *Security Group*: Choose whether to create a new security group or whether to select an existing security group that allows the required inbound and outbound rules.
+
link:reference-ports-azure.html[View security group rules for Azure].

* *Review*: Review your selections to verify that your set up is correct.

. Click *Add*.
+
The virtual machine should be ready in about 7 minutes. You should stay on the page until the process is complete.

.Result

After the process is complete, the Connector is available for use from BlueXP.
