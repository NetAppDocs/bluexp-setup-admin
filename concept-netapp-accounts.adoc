When you use private mode, you'll use a _BlueXP account_ to manage users and organize resources in an isolated _workspace_. 

If you're using standard mode or restricted mode, you won't have a account. Instead, you'll have an _organization_ that you manage using identity and access management (IAM).

== Overview

When you first access BlueXP, an account is already created for you with a workspace called _Workspace-1_. 

You can then add members (users) to this account and deploy Connectors:

== Members

Members are users that you associate with your account. Associating a user with an account and your workspace in that account enables those users to create and manage working environments.


== Workspace

A workspace isolates any number of _working environments_ from other users in the account. Users (members) can't access the working environments in a workspace unless they are associated with that workspace.

A working environment represents a storage system such as your on-premises ONTAP cluster.

BlueXP private mode supports only one workspace.


== Connectors

A Connector executes the actions needed in order to manage your data infrastructure. The Connector runs on a virtual machine instance that you deploy in your cloud provider or on an on-premises host that you configured.

You can use a Connector with more than one data service. For example, if you're using a Connector to manage backup and recovery, you can use that same Connector with another service like tiering.
