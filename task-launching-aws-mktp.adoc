summary: For an AWS commercial region, it's best to create a Connector directly from BlueXP, but you can launch a Connector from the AWS Marketplace, if you prefer. For AWS Government regions, you can't deploy the Connector in a Government region from the BlueXP SaaS website, so the next best option is to do so from the AWS Marketplace.

For an AWS commercial region, it's best to create a Connector directly from BlueXP, but you can launch a Connector from the AWS Marketplace, if you prefer. For AWS Government regions, you can't deploy the Connector in a Government region from the BlueXP SaaS website, so the next best option is to do so from the AWS Marketplace.

TIP: You can also download and install the Connector software on an existing Linux host in your network or in the cloud. link:task-installing-linux.html[Learn how to install the Connector on an existing Linux host].

== Create the Connector in an AWS commercial region

You can launch the Connector instance in an AWS commercial region directly from the AWS Marketplace offering for BlueXP.

.Before you get started

The IAM user who creates the Connector must have AWS Marketplace permissions to subscribe and unsubscribe.

.Steps

. Set up permissions in AWS:

.. From the IAM console, create the required policies by copying and pasting the contents of link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the IAM policies for the Connector].

.. Create an IAM role with the role type Amazon EC2 and attach the policies that you created in the previous step to the role.

. Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B018REK8QG[BlueXP page on the AWS Marketplace^] to deploy the Connector from an AMI:

. On the Marketplace page, click *Continue to Subscribe* and then click *Continue to Configuration*.
+

. Change any of the default options and click *Continue to Launch*.

. Under *Choose Action*, select *Launch through EC2* and then click *Launch*.
+
These steps describe how to launch the instance from the EC2 Console because the console enables you to attach an IAM role to the Connector instance. This isn't possible using the *Launch from Website* action.

. Follow the prompts to configure and deploy the instance:

* *Name and tags*: Enter a name and tags for the instance.

* *Application and OS Image*: Skip this section. The Connector AMI is already selected.

* *Instance type*: Depending on region availability, choose one of the supported instance types (t3.xlarge is recommended).
+
link:task-installing-linux.html[Review the instance requirements].

* *Key pair (login)*: Select the key pair that you want to use to securely connect to the instance.

* *Network settings*: Edit the network settings as needed:
+
** Choose the desired VPC and subnet.
** Specify whether the instance should have a public IP address.
** Specify firewall settings that enable the required connection methods for the Connector instance: SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.

* *Configure storage*: Keep the default storage options.

* *Advanced details*: Under *IAM instance profile*, choose the IAM role that you created in step 1.

* *Summary*: Review the summary and click *Launch instance*.
+
AWS launches the software with the specified settings. The Connector instance and software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector instance and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:
.. Specify the NetApp account to associate with the Connector.
+
link:concept-netapp-accounts.html[Learn about NetApp accounts].
.. Enter a name for the system.

. Open a web browser and go to https://console.bluexp.netapp.com to start using the Connector with BlueXP.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your NetApp account. BlueXP will automatically use this Connector when you create new working environments. But if you have more than one Connector, you'll need to link:task-managing-connectors.html[switch between them].

If you have Amazon S3 buckets in the same AWS account where you created the Connector, you'll see an Amazon S3 working environment appear on the Canvas automatically. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-s3-storage/index.html[Learn more about what you can do with this working environment].

== Create the Connector in an AWS Government region

To deploy the Connector in an AWS Government region, you need to go to the EC2 service and select the BlueXP offering from the AWS Marketplace.

.Steps

. Set up permissions in AWS:

.. From the IAM console, create your own policy by copying and pasting the contents of link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the IAM policy for the Connector].

.. Create an IAM role with the role type Amazon EC2 and attach the policy that you created in the previous step to the role.

. Go to the BlueXP offering in the AWS Marketplace.
+
The IAM user must have AWS Marketplace permissions to subscribe and unsubscribe.

.. Open the EC2 service and select *Launch instance*.
.. Select *AWS Marketplace*.
.. Search for BlueXP and select the offering.
+
image:screenshot-gov-cloud-mktp.png[A screenshot that shows the BlueXP offering after searching for it in the AWS Marketplace]

.. Click *Continue*.

. Follow the prompts to configure and deploy the instance:

* *Choose an Instance Type*: Depending on region availability, choose one of the supported instance types (t3.xlarge is recommended).
+
link:task-installing-linux.html[Review the instance requirements].

* *Configure Instance Details*: Select a VPC and subnet, choose the IAM role that you created in step 1, enable termination protection (recommended), and choose any other configuration options that meet your requirements.
+
image:screenshot_aws_iam_role.gif[A screenshot that shows fields on the Configure Instance page in AWS. The IAM role that you should have created in step 1 is selected.]

* *Add Storage*: Keep the default storage options.

* *Add Tags*: Enter tags for the instance, if desired.

* *Configure Security Group*: Specify the required connection methods for the Connector instance: SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.

* *Review*: Review your selections and click *Launch*.

+
AWS launches the software with the specified settings. The Connector instance and software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector instance and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:
.. Specify the NetApp account to associate with the Connector.
+
link:concept-netapp-accounts.html[Learn about NetApp accounts].
.. Enter a name for the system.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your NetApp account.

Any time that you want to use BlueXP, open your web browser and connect to the IP address of the Connector instance: https://_ipaddress_

Since the Connector was deployed in a Government region, it's not accessible from https://console.bluexp.netapp.com.

== Open port 3128 for AutoSupport messages

If you plan to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in a subnet where an outbound internet connection won't be available, then BlueXP automatically configures Cloud Volumes ONTAP to use the Connector as a proxy server.

The only requirement is to ensure that the Connector's security group allows _inbound_ connections over port 3128. You'll need to open this port after you deploy the Connector.

If you use the default security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then no changes are needed to its security group. But if you plan to define strict outbound rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you'll also need to ensure that the Cloud Volumes ONTAP security group allows _outbound_ connections over port 3128.
