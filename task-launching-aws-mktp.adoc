summary: For an AWS commercial region, it's best to create a Connector directly from BlueXP, but you can launch a Connector from the AWS Marketplace, if you prefer. For AWS Government regions, you can't deploy the Connector in a Government region from the BlueXP SaaS website, so the next best option is to do so from the AWS Marketplace.
