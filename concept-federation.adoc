[.lead]
You can enable single sign-on (SSO) for BlueXP by setting up identity federation with your corporate identity management provider or you can choose to federate with the NetApp Support Site. 

.Required role

You need to have the Organization administrator role to set up identity federation.


== Identity federation with NSS credentials 

If you federate with the NetApp Support Site, you can use your NetApp Support Site credentials to log in to BlueXP. This is useful if you want to use the same credentials for both sites and if all of your users have NetApp Support Site accounts.

NOTE: If you federate with the NetApp Support Site, you can't also federate with your corporate identity management provider. Choose which one works best for your organization.

To set up identity federation with the NetApp Support Site, you need to complete the following steps:

* Download and complete the https://kb.netapp.com/@api/deki/files/98382/NetApp-B2C-Federation-Request-Form-April-2022.docx?revision=1[NetApp Federation Request Form^]
* Submit the form to the email address specified in the form

The NetApp support team will review and process your request.

== How identity federation works

Setting up identity federation creates a trust connection between BlueXP's authentication service provider (Auth0) and your own identity management provider.

The following image depicts how identity federation works with BlueXP:

image:diagram-identity-federation.png[A diagram that shows a user authenticating with BlueXP and a connection between BlueXP and an identity provider that authenticates the user.]

. The user enters their email address on the BlueXP login page.
. BlueXP identifies that the email domain is part of a federated connection and sends the authentication request to the identity provider using the trusted connection.
+
When you set up a federated connection, BlueXP always uses that federated connection for authentication.
. The user authenticates by using credentials from your corporate directory.
. Your identity provider authenticates the user's identity and the user is logged in to BlueXP.

Identity federation uses open standards, such as Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

== Supported identity providers

BlueXP supports the following identity providers:

* Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity providers
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
* PingFederate

NetApp supports service provider-initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. You need to first configure the identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. Then, you can create a connection in BlueXP that uses the identity provider's configuration.

== Set up a federated connection
You can set up a federated connection with your identity provider to enable single sign-on (SSO) for BlueXP. The process involves configuring your identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider and then creating the connection in BlueXP.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can only use verified domains for federation. If you want to federate with a domain that is different than your email domain, you must first verify that you own the domain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need to configure your identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. This involves creating a new application in your identity provider and providing the necessary information, such as the ACS URL and Entity ID. Service provider information varies by identity provider, so refer to the documentation for your specific identity provider for details.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To create the connection, you'll need to provide the necessary information from your identity provider, such as the SAML metadata URL or file. This information is used to establish the trust relationship between BlueXP and your identity provider. The information you provide depends on the IdP that you are using. For example, if you're using Microsoft Entra ID, you'll need to provide the client ID, secret, and domain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Before you can enable the connection, you can test it to ensure that everything is working correctly. The Federation page in BlueXP provides a test option that allows you to verify that the connection is working as expected. If the test is successful, you can enable the connection.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When you enable the connection, users can log in to BlueXP using their corporate credentials. 

BlueXP provides a wizard to help you set up your connection. Review the topics for your individual identity provider to get started:
