Single-sign on (federation) allows users to log in to using their corporate credentials, which simplifies the login process and enhances security. You can enable single sign-on (SSO) with your identity provider (IdP) or with the NetApp Support site.

== Identity federation with NetApp Support Site credentials

When you federate with the NetApp Support Site (NSS), users log in to BlueXP with their NSS credentials. This is useful if you want to use the same credentials for both sites and if all of your users have NetApp Support Site accounts. 

Federating with the NetApp Support Site makes it easier for users to interact with NetApp support when needed and also allows BlueXP to access information about your NetApp products and services.

If you would rather federate with your IdP, you can later associate one or more individual NetApp Support Site accounts with your BlueXP organization. When at least one NSS account is associated with your organization, BlueXP can access information about your NetApp products and services and the associated login can submit support cases directly from BlueXP.


NOTE: If you federate with the NetApp Support Site, you can't also federate with your corporate identity management provider. Choose which one works best for your organization.

== Supported identity providers

BlueXP supports the following identity providers:

* Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity providers
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
* PingFederate

NetApp supports service provider-initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. You need to first configure the identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. Then, you can create a connection in BlueXP that uses the identity provider's configuration.

== Set up a federated connection with your identity provider
You can set up a federated connection with your identity provider to enable single sign-on (SSO) for BlueXP. The process involves configuring your identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider and then creating the connection in BlueXP.

=== Supported identity providers

NetApp supports the following identity providers:

* Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity providers
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
* PingFederate

=== Federation with BlueXP workflow

NetApp supports service provider-initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. You need to first configure the identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. Then, you can create a connection in BlueXP that uses the identity provider's configuration.

You can federate with your email domain or with a different domain that you own. If you want to federate with a domain that is different than your email domain, you must first verify that you own the domain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can only use verified domains for federation. If you want to federate with a domain that is different than your email domain, you must first verify that you own the domain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You configure your identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider by creating a new application and providing the necessary information, such as the ACS URL and Entity ID. Service provider information varies by identity provider, so refer to the documentation for your specific identity provider for details.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To create the connection, you'll need to provide the necessary information from your identity provider, such as the SAML metadata URL or file. This information is used to establish the trust relationship between BlueXP and your identity provider. The information you provide depends on the IdP that you are using. For example, if you're using Microsoft Entra ID, you'll need to provide the client ID, secret, and domain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Test the connection to ensure it works before enabling it. The Federation page in BlueXP provides a test option that allows you to verify that the connection is working as expected. If the test is successful, you can enable the connection.

After you enable the connection, users can log in to BlueXP using their corporate credentials.
