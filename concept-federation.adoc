Identity federation enables single sign-on with BlueXP so that users can log in using credentials from your corporate identity. You should understand how BlueXP supports identity federation before you set up a connection with your identity provider.

== How identity federation works

Setting up identity federation creates a trust connection between BlueXP's authentication service provider (auth0) and your own identity management provider.

The following image depicts how identity federation works with BlueXP:

image:diagram-identity-federation.png[A diagram that shows a user authenticating with BlueXP and a connection between BlueXP and an identity provider that authenticates the user.]

. A user enters their email address on the BlueXP login page.
. BlueXP identifies that the email domain is part of a federated connection and sends the authentication request to the identity provider using the trusted connection.
+
When you set up a federated connection, BlueXP always uses that federated connection for authentication.
. The user authenticates by using credentials from your corporate directory.
. Your identity provider authenticates the user's identity and the user is logged in to BlueXP.

Identity federation uses open standards, such as Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

== Supported identity providers

BlueXP supports the following identity providers:

* Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
* Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD)
* Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity providers
* PingFederate

BlueXP supports service provider initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. Identity provider initiated (IdP-initiated) SSO is not supported.

== Overview of the setup process

Before you set up a connection between BlueXP and your identity management provider, you should understand the steps that you'll need to take so that you can prepare accordingly.

=== ADFS

At a high-level, setting up a federated connection between BlueXP and ADFS includes the following steps:

| Step
| Completed by
| Description

| 1 | AD admin a| Configure your ADFS server to enable identity federation with our authentication provider (auth0).

https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/adfs[View instructions for configuring your ADFS server with auth0^]

TIP: Do _not_ complete the steps that describe how to create a connection with auth0. You'll create that connection in the next step.

| 2 | BlueXP admin a| Create a connection from your ADFS server to BlueXP from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^]

To complete this step, you need to obtain the following from your AD admin: the URL for the ADFS server or the federation metadata file.

After you create the connection using this information, the Federation Setup page lists the parameters that you can send to your AD admin to complete the configuration in the next step.

| 3 | AD admin | Complete the configuration on the ADFS server using the parameters shown on the Federation Setup page after finishing step 2.

| 4 | BlueXP admin | Test and enable the connection from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^]

=== Microsoft Azure AD

[cols="10,20,60",width=100%,options="header"]

| Step
| Completed by
| Description

| 1 | AD admin a| Create a new application in Azure Active Directory along with a client secret.

https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/azure-active-directory/v2[View instructions for registering the application with Azure AD^]

TIP: Do _not_ complete the steps that describe how to create a connection with auth0. You'll create that connection in the next step.

| 2 | BlueXP admin a| Create a connection from Azure AD to BlueXP from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^]

To complete this step, you need to obtain the following from your AD admin: 

* Client ID
* Client secret
* Microsoft Azure AD domain

After you create the connection using this information, the Federation Setup page lists the parameters that you can send to your AD admin to complete the configuration in the next step.

| 3 | AD admin | Complete the configuration in Azure AD using the parameters shown on the Federation Setup page after finishing step 2.

| 4 | BlueXP admin | Test and enable the connection from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^]

=== SAML identity provider

[cols="10,20,60",width=100%,options="header"]

| Step
| Completed by
| Description

| 1 | AD admin a| Create a new connection with your SAML identity provider.

https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/azure-active-directory/v2[View instructions for registering the application with Azure AD^]

The steps vary, depending on your SAML identity provider:

* https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider/configure-adfs-saml-connections[ADFS^]
* https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider/configure-okta-as-saml-identity-provider[Okta^]
* https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider/configure-onelogin-as-saml-identity-provider[OneLogin^]
* https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider/configure-pingfederate-as-saml-identity-provider[PingFederate^]
* https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider/configure-salesforce-as-saml-identity-provider[SalesForce^]
* https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider/configure-siteminder-as-saml-identity-provider[SiteMinder^]
* https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider/configure-ssocircle-as-saml-identity-provider[SSOCircle^]

If your identity provider doesn't appear in the list above, https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider[follow these generic instructions^]

TIP: Do _not_ complete the steps that describe how to create a connection with auth0. You'll create that connection in the next step.

| 2 | BlueXP admin a| Create a connection from your SAML identity provider to BlueXP from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^]

To complete this step, you need to obtain the following from your AD admin about the identity provider: 

* Sign in URL
* An X509 signing certificate (PEM or CER format)
* Sign out URL (optional)

After you create the connection using this information, the Federation Setup page lists the parameters that you can send to your AD admin to complete the configuration in the next step.

| 3 | AD admin | Complete the configuration on the identity provider using the parameters shown on the Federation Setup page after finishing step 2.

| 4 | BlueXP admin | Test and enable the connection from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^]

TIP: Do _not_ complete the steps that describe how to create a connection with auth0. You'll create that connection in the next step.

| 2 | BlueXP admin a| Create a connection from the PingFederate server to BlueXP from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^]

To complete this step, you need to obtain the following from your AD admin: 

* The URL for the PingFederate server
* An X509 signing certificate (PEM or CER format)

After you create the connection using this information, the Federation Setup page lists the parameters that you can send to your AD admin to complete the configuration in the next step.

| 3 | AD admin | Complete the configuration on the PingFederate server using the parameters shown on the Federation Setup page after finishing step 2.

| 4 | BlueXP admin | Test and enable the connection from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^]

== Update a federated connection

After the BlueXP admin enables a connection, the admin can update the connection at any time from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^] 

For example, you might need to update the connection by uploading a new certificate.

The BlueXP admin who created the connection is the only authorized user who can update the connection.
