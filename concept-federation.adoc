Single-sign on (federation) simplifies the login process and enhances security by allowing users to log in to BlueXP using their corporate credentials. You can enable single sign-on (SSO) with your identity provider (IdP) or with the NetApp Support site.

== Identity federation with NetApp Support Site

When you federate with the NetApp Support Site, users can login with the same credentials to access BlueXP as you use for the NetApp Support Site, Active IQ Digital Advisor and other apps associated with your NetApp Support Site account.  After you set up federation, any new users who create a NetApp Support Site accounts will also be able to access BlueXP.


NOTE: If you federate with the NetApp Support Site, you can't also federate with your corporate identity management provider. Choose which one works best for your organization.

== Set up a federated connection with your identity provider
You can set up a federated connection with your identity provider to enable single sign-on (SSO) for BlueXP. The process involves configuring your identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider and then creating the connection in BlueXP.

=== Supported identity providers

NetApp supports the following protocols and identity providers for federation:

.Protocols
* Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity providers
* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)

.Identity providers
* Microsoft Entra ID
* PingFederate

=== Federation with BlueXP workflow

NetApp supports service provider-initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. You need to first configure the identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. Then, you can create a connection in BlueXP that uses the identity provider's configuration.

You can federate with your email domain or with a different domain that you own. To federate with a domain different from your email domain, first verify you own the domain.

If you want to federate with a domain that is different than your email domain, you must first verify that you own the domain. You can federate your email domain without any extra steps.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You configure your identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider by creating a new application and providing the necessary information, such as the ACS URL, Entity ID or other credential information. Service provider information varies by identity provider, so refer to the documentation for your specific identity provider for details. You'll need to work with your IdP administrator to complete this step.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To create the connection, you'll need to provide the necessary information from your identity provider, such as the SAML metadata URL or file. This information is used to establish the trust relationship between BlueXP and your identity provider. The information you provide depends on the IdP that you are using. For example, if you're using Microsoft Entra ID, you'll need to provide the client ID, secret, and domain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Test your federated connection to ensure it works before enabling it. The Federation page in BlueXP provides a test option that allows you to verify your test user is able to authenticate successfully. If the test is successful, you can enable the connection.

After you enable the connection, users can log in to BlueXP using their corporate credentials.
