Creating a Connector on your premises includes a few steps.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need a network location that has outbound internet access to specific endpoints. If a proxy server is required for outbound internet, then you'll need the IP address, credentials, and HTTPS certificate.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on. If you plan to manually install the Connector, you should ensure that your hosts meets these requirements.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Set up permissions for your cloud provider so that you can use BlueXP to manage storage in the cloud:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *AWS*: Create an IAM policy and attach the policy to an IAM user. After installation, you need to provide BlueXP with access keys for that IAM user. 

* *Azure*: Set up a service principal in Azure Active Directory that includes the required permissions. After installation, you need to provide BlueXP with the credentials for the service principal.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When the Connector is installed on your premises, it can't manage storage or data in Google Cloud. The Connector must be installed in Google Cloud to manage any storage or data that resides there.
