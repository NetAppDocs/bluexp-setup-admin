Create a Connector on your premises by setting up networking, preparing a host, preparing cloud permissions, and more.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Prepare the following for the Connector:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* A network location where you plan to install the Connector
* A network connection to the networks where you're planning to create and manage working environments
* Outbound internet access to specific endpoints for day-to-day operations
* The IP address, credentials, and HTTPS certificate of a proxy server, if a proxy server is required for outbound internet

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific requirements. The key requirements are as follows:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* A dedicated host running CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux
* 4 CPUs
* 14 GB of RAM
* Docker Engine

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Set up permissions for your cloud provider so that you can use BlueXP to manage storage in the cloud:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *AWS*: Create an IAM policy and attach the policy to an IAM user. After installation, you need to provide BlueXP with access keys for that IAM user. 

* *Azure*: Set up a service principal in Azure Active Directory that includes the required permissions. After installation, you need to provide BlueXP with the credentials for the service principal.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When the Connector is installed on your premises, it can't manage storage or data in Google Cloud. The Connector must be installed in Google Cloud to manage any storage or data that resides there.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
After you install and set up the Connector, you need to add your cloud credentials so that BlueXP has the required permissions to perform actions in AWS or Azure.
