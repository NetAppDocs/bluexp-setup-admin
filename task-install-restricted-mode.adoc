.Azure Marketplace
--
.What you'll need

* A VNet and subnet that meets networking requirements.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html[Learn about networking requirements]

* An Azure custom role that includes the required permissions for the Connector.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html#prepare-cloud-permissions[Learn how to set up Azure permissions]

.Steps

. Go to the NetApp Connector VM page in the Azure Marketplace.
+
* https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manager[Azure Marketplace page for commercial regions^]
* https://portal.azure.us/#create/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manageroccm-byol[Azure Marketplace page for Azure Government regions^]

. Click *Get it now* and then click *Continue*.

. From the Azure portal, click *Create* and follow the steps to configure the virtual machine.
+
Note the following as you configure the VM:

* *VM size*: Choose a VM size that meets CPU and RAM requirements. We recommend DS3 v2.

* *Disks*: The Connector can perform optimally with either HDD or SSD disks.

* *Public IP*: If you want to use a public IP address with the Connector VM, the IP address must use a Basic SKU to ensure that BlueXP uses this public IP address.
+
image:screenshot-azure-sku.png[A screenshot of the create new IP address in Azure that enables you to choose Basic under in the SKU field.]
+
If you use a Standard SKU IP address instead, then BlueXP uses the _private_ IP address of the Connector, instead of the public IP. If the machine that you're using to access the BlueXP Console doesn't have access to that private IP address, then actions from the BlueXP Console will fail.
+
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses#sku[Azure documentation: Public IP SKU^]

* *Network security group*: The Connector requires inbound connections using SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html[Learn about networking requirements].

* *Identity*: Under *Management*, select *Enable system assigned managed identity*.
+
This setting is important because a managed identity allows the Connector virtual machine to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without providing any credentials. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[Learn more about managed identities for Azure resources^].

. On the *Review + create* page, review your selections and click *Create* to start the deployment.

.Result

Azure deploys the virtual machine with the specified settings. The virtual machine and Connector software should be running in approximately five minutes.

== Set up BlueXP

When you access the BlueXP console for the first time, you'll be prompted to choose an account to associate the Connector with and you'll need to enable restricted mode.

NOTE: If you already have an account and you want to create another one, then you need to use the Tenancy API. link:task-create-account.html[Learn how to create an additional BlueXP account].

.Steps

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector instance and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. Sign up or log in to BlueXP.

. After you're logged in, set up BlueXP:

.. Enter a name for the Connector.

.. Enter a name for a new BlueXP account or select an existing account.
+
You can select an existing account if your log in is already associated with a BlueXP account.

.. Select *Are you running in a secured environment?*

.. Select *Enable restricted mode on this account*.
+
Note that you can't change this setting after BlueXP creates the account. You can't enable restricted mode later and you can't disable it later.
+
If you deployed the Connector in a Government region, the checkbox is already enabled and can't be changed. This is because restricted mode is the only mode supported in Government regions.
+
image:screenshot-restricted-mode.png["A screenshot that shows the welcome page where you need to enter a Connector name, account name, and can enable restricted mode on this account."]

.. Click *Let's start*.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your BlueXP account. All users need to access BlueXP using the IP address of the Connector instance.

.What's next?

Provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously set up.

== Provide permissions to BlueXP

If you deployed the Connector from the Azure Marketplace or if you manually installed the Connector software, you need to provide the permissions that you previously set up so that you can use BlueXP services.

These steps don't apply if you deployed the Connector from the AWS Marketplace because you chose the required IAM role during deployment.
