summary: For an Azure commercial region, it's best to create a Connector directly from BlueXP, but you can launch a Connector from the Azure Marketplace, if you prefer. For Azure Government regions, you can't deploy the Connector in a Government region from the BlueXP SaaS website, so the next best option is to do so from the Azure Marketplace.

For an Azure commercial region, it's best to create a Connector directly from BlueXP, but you can launch a Connector from the Azure Marketplace, if you prefer. For Azure Government regions, you can't deploy the Connector in a Government region from the BlueXP SaaS website, so the next best option is to do so from the Azure Marketplace.

TIP: You can also download and install the Connector software on an existing Linux host in your network or in the cloud. link:task-installing-linux.html[Learn how to install the Connector on an existing Linux host].

== Creating a Connector in Azure

Deploy the Connector in Azure using the image in the Azure Marketplace and then log in to the Connector to specify your NetApp account.

.Steps

. Go to the NetApp Connector VM page in the Azure Marketplace.
+
* https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manager[Azure Marketplace page for commercial regions^]
* https://portal.azure.us/#create/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manageroccm-byol[Azure Marketplace page for Azure Government regions^]

. Click *Get it now* and then click *Continue*.

. From the Azure portal, click *Create* and follow the steps to configure the virtual machine.
+
Note the following as you configure the VM:

* The Connector can perform optimally with either HDD or SSD disks.

* Choose a VM size that meets CPU and RAM requirements. We recommend DS3 v2.
+
link:task-installing-linux.html[Review the VM requirements].

* For the network security group, the Connector requires inbound connections using SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
+
link:reference-ports-azure.html[Learn more about security group rules for the Connector].

* Under *Management*, enable *System assigned managed identity* for the Connector by selecting *On*.
+
This setting is important because a managed identity allows the Connector virtual machine to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without providing any credentials. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[Learn more about managed identities for Azure resources^].

. On the *Review + create* page, review your selections and click *Create* to start the deployment.
+
Azure deploys the virtual machine with the specified settings. The virtual machine and Connector software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector virtual machine and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:
.. Specify the NetApp account to associate with the Connector.
+
link:concept-netapp-accounts.html[Learn about NetApp accounts].
.. Enter a name for the system.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your NetApp account.

If the Connector is in an Azure commercial region, open a web browser and go to https://console.bluexp.netapp.com to start using the Connector with BlueXP.

If the Connector is in an Azure Government region, you can use BlueXP by opening your web browser and connecting to the IP address of the Connector instance: https://_ipaddress_

Since the Connector was deployed in a Government region, it's not accessible from https://console.bluexp.netapp.com.

== Granting Azure permissions

When you deployed the Connector in Azure, you should have enabled a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[system-assigned managed identity^]. You must now grant the required Azure permissions by creating a custom role and then by assigning the role to the Connector virtual machine for one or more subscriptions.

.Steps

. Create a custom role:

.. Copy the contents of the link:reference-permissions-azure.html[custom role permissions for the Connector] and save them in a JSON file.

.. Modify the JSON file by adding Azure subscription IDs to the assignable scope.
+
You should add the ID for each Azure subscription from which users will create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.
+
*Example*
+
[source,json]
"AssignableScopes": [
"/subscriptions/d333af45-0d07-4154-943d-c25fbzzzzzzz",
"/subscriptions/54b91999-b3e6-4599-908e-416e0zzzzzzz",
"/subscriptions/398e471c-3b42-4ae7-9b59-ce5bbzzzzzzz"

.. Use the JSON file to create a custom role in Azure.
+
The following steps describe how to create the role by using Bash in Azure Cloud Shell.
+
* Start https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview[Azure Cloud Shell^] and choose the Bash environment.

* Upload the JSON file.
+
image:screenshot_azure_shell_upload.png[A screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell where you can choose the option to upload a file.]

* Enter the following Azure CLI command:
+
[source,azurecli]
az role definition create --role-definition Policy_for_Setup_As_Service_Azure.json
+
You should now have a custom role called BlueXP Operator that you can assign to the Connector virtual machine.

. Assign the role to the Connector virtual machine for one or more subscriptions:

.. Open the *Subscriptions* service and then select the subscription in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

.. Click *Access control (IAM)* > *Add* > *Add role assignment*.

.. In the *Role* tab, select the *BlueXP Operator* role and click *Next*.
+
NOTE: BlueXP Operator is the default name provided in the BlueXP policy. If you chose a different name for the role, then select that name instead.

.. In the *Members* tab, complete the following steps:

* Assign access to a *Managed identity*.

* Click *Select members*, select the subscription in which the Connector virtual machine was created, choose *Virtual machine*, and then select the Connector virtual machine.

* Click *Select*.

* Click *Next*.

.. Click *Review + assign*.

.. If you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP from additional subscriptions, switch to that subscription and then repeat these steps.

.Result

The Connector now has the permissions that it needs to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. BlueXP will automatically use this Connector when you create new working environments. But if you have more than one Connector, you'll need to link:task-managing-connectors.html[switch between them].

If you have Azure Blob storage in the same Azure account where you created the Connector, you'll see an Azure Blob working environment appear on the Canvas automatically. link:task-viewing-azure-blob.html[Learn more about what you can do with this working environment].

== Open port 3128 for AutoSupport messages

If you plan to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in a subnet where an outbound internet connection won't be available, then BlueXP automatically configures Cloud Volumes ONTAP to use the Connector as a proxy server.

The only requirement is to ensure that the Connector's security group allows _inbound_ connections over port 3128. You'll need to open this port after you deploy the Connector.

If you use the default security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then no changes are needed to its security group. But if you plan to define strict outbound rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you'll also need to ensure that the Cloud Volumes ONTAP security group allows _outbound_ connections over port 3128.
