summary: For an Azure commercial region, it's best to create a Connector directly from BlueXP, but you can launch a Connector from the Azure Marketplace, if you prefer. For Azure Government regions, you can't deploy the Connector in a Government region from the BlueXP SaaS website, so the next best option is to do so from the Azure Marketplace.
