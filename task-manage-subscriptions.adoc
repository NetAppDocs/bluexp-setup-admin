When you subscribe to BlueXP from a cloud provider's marketplace, you're redirected to the BlueXP website where you need to save your subscription and associate it with specific accounts. After you've subscribed, each subscription is available to manage from the Digital Wallet. 

== View your subscriptions

The Digital Wallet provides details about each PAYGO subscription and annual contract associated with your BlueXP account and with Astra (Astra uses BlueXP's charging service).

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Select *Subscriptions*.
+
You'll only see the subscriptions that are associated with the account that you're currently viewing.

. As you view the information about your subscriptions, you can interact with the details in the table as follows:
+
* Expand a row to view more details.

* Select image:icon-column-selector.png[the plus icon at the end of the table header] to choose which columns appear in the table. 
+
Note that the Term and Auto Renew columns don't appear by default. The Auto Renew column displays renewal information for Azure contracts only.

+
Note the following about what you see in the table:

Start date::
The start date is when you successfully associated the subscription with your account and charging started.

N/A::
If you see N/A in the table, the information isn't available from the cloud provider's API at this time.

Contracts::
* If you expand the details for a contract, the Digital Wallet shows what's available for your current plan: the contract options and units (capacity or number of nodes).
* The Digital Wallet will identify the end date and whether the contract will renew soon, end soon, or whether it has already ended.
* If you have an AWS contract and you changed any of the contract's options after the start date, be sure to validate your contract options from the AWS.

== Manage your subscriptions

You can manage your subscriptions from the Digital Wallet by renaming a subscription and choosing the accounts that are associated with the subscription.

For example, let's say that you have two accounts and each is billed through separate subscriptions. You might disassociate a subscription from one of the accounts so the users in that account don't accidentally choose the wrong subscription when creating a Cloud Volume ONTAP working environment.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Select *Subscriptions*.

. Select the action menu in the row that corresponds to the subscription that you want to manage.
