If your corporate policies require you to use a proxy server for all communication to the internet, then you need to configure your Connectors to use that proxy server. If you didn't configure a Connector to use a proxy server during installation, then you can configure the Connector to use that proxy server at any time.

Using a proxy server with the Connector enables outbound internet access when no public IP or NAT gateway is available. The proxy server provides outbound connectivity only for the Connector, not for Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

If Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems don't have an outbound internet connection to send AutoSupport messages, BlueXP automatically configures those Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems to use a proxy server that's included with the Connector. You must ensure that the Connector's security group allows inbound connections over port 3128. Open this port after you deploy the Connector.

== Supported configurations

* Explicit and transparent proxies are supported. 
* HTTP and HTTPS. 
* The proxy server can be in the cloud or in your network. 


== Enable an explicit proxy on a Connector

When you configure a Connector to use a proxy server, that Connector and the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that it manages (including any HA mediators), all use the proxy server.

This operation restarts the Connector. Ensure that the Connector isn't performing any operations before you proceed.

. Select *HTTP Proxy Configuration*.

. Select *Explicit proxy* in the Configuration type field.

. Select *Enable Proxy*.
. Specify the server using the syntax http://_address:port_ or https://_address:port_
. Specify a user name and password if basic authentication is required for the server.

+
Note the following:
+
* The user can be a local user or domain user.
* For a domain user, you must enter the ASCII code for the \ as follows: domain-name%92user-name
+
For example: netapp%92proxy
* BlueXP doesn't support passwords that include the @ character.



. Select *Save*.

[[transparent-proxy]]
=== Enable a transparent proxy on a Connector
Only BlueXP Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) supports using a transparent proxy on the Connector. If you use BlueXP services in addition to Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you should create a separate Connector either for the services or for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. 

To configure an existing Connector to use a transparent proxy server, you use both the BlueXP console and the Connector maintenance tool that is available through the command line on the Connector host. 

Configuring a proxy server restarts the Connector. Ensure that the Connector isn't performing any operations before you proceed.


.Steps

. Navigate to the *Edit BlueXP Connector* page:
+
Navigation depends on your BlueXP mode. In standard mode, access the interface from the SaaS website. In restricted or private mode, access it locally from the Connector host.

. Open a command-line interface on the Connector host.

. Navigate to the Connector maintenance tool directory: /opt/application/netapp/service-manager-2/connector-maint-console 



== Enable direct API traffic

If you configured a Connector to use a proxy server, you can enable direct API traffic on the Connector in order to send API calls directly to cloud provider services without going through the proxy. Connectors running in AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud support this option.

If you disable Azure Private Links with Cloud Volumes ONTAP and use service endpoints, enable direct API traffic. Otherwise, the traffic won't be routed properly.
