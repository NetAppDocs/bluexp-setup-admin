[role="quick-margin-para"]
The standard way to create a Connector in Google Cloud is directly from BlueXP, but you can also create it using gcloud, or by manually installing the software on a pre-existing Linux host.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you want to manually install the Connector software on your own Linux host, then you should ensure that your host meets specific requirements. If you're creating the Connector from BlueXP or by using gcloud, then these requirements are taken care of for you because the software is deployed from an image.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The key requirements are as follows:

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Set up Google Cloud permissions for the installation option that you're planning to use:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *Installation from BlueXP or gcloud*: Create a custom role and attach it to the user who will deploy the Connector. Create another custom role and assign it to a service account for the Connector VM instance.

* *Manual install*: Create a custom role and assign it to a service account for the Connector VM instance.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you manually installed the Connector software on your own Linux host, you need to provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously set up.
