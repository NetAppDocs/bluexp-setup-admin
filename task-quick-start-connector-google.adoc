Creating a Connector in Google Cloud includes a few steps.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The standard way to create a Connector in Google Cloud is directly from BlueXP, but you can also create it using gcloud, or by manually installing the software on a pre-existing Linux host.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need a VPC and subnet with outbound internet access to specific endpoints. If a proxy server is required for outbound internet, then you'll need the IP address, credentials, and HTTPS certificate.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on. If you plan to manually install the Connector, you should ensure that your hosts meets these requirements.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *Installation from BlueXP or gcloud*: Create a custom role and attach it to the user who will deploy the Connector. Create another custom role and assign it to a service account for the Connector VM instance.

* *Manual install*: Create a custom role and assign it to a service account for the Connector VM instance.
