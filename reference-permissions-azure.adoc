When BlueXP launches the Connector VM in Azure, it attaches a custom role to the VM that provides the Connector with permissions to manage resources and processes within that Azure subscription. The Connector uses the permissions to make API calls to several Azure services.

== Custom role permissions

The custom role shown below provides the permissions that a Connector needs to manage resources and processes within your Azure network.

When you create a Connector directly from BlueXP, BlueXP automatically applies this custom role to the Connector.

If you deploy the Connector from the Azure Marketplace or if you manually install the Connector on a Linux host, then you'll need to set up the custom role yourself.

You also need to ensure that the role is up to date as new permissions are added in subsequent releases.
