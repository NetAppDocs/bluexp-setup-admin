To manually install the Connector on your own Linux host, you need to review host requirements, set up your networking, prepare Google Cloud permissions, enable Google Cloud APIs, install the Connector, and then provide the permissions that you prepared.

.Before you begin

You should review link:reference-limitations.html[Connector limitations].

== Step 1: Review host requirements

The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on.

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=google-machine]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=disk-space]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=docker]

== Step 2: Set up networking

Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment. For example, you need to ensure that connections are available to target networks and that outbound internet access is available.

//Connections to target networks
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=networks]

//Outbound internet access
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=outbound]

//Endpoints contacted during manual installation

//Endpoints contacted from the Connector

//Ports

== Step 3: Set up permissions for the Connector

include::_include/google-set-up-connector-permissions.adoc[]

== Step 4: Set up shared VPC permissions

include::_include/google-shared-vpc-permissions.adoc[]

== Step 5: Enable Google Cloud APIs

Several Google Cloud APIs must be enabled before you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in Google Cloud.

.Step

. Enable the following Google Cloud APIs in your project:

include::_include/google-cloud-apis.adoc[]

https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis[Google Cloud documentation: Enabling APIs^]

== Step 6: Install the Connector

After the pre-requisites are complete, you can manually install the software on your own Linux host.

// end tabbed area

== Step 7: Provide permissions to BlueXP

You need to provide BlueXP with the Google Cloud permissions that you previously set up. Providing the permissions enables BlueXP to manage your data and storage infrastructure in Google Cloud.

.Steps

. Go to the Google Cloud portal and assign the service account to the Connector VM instance.
+
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#changeserviceaccountandscopes[Google Cloud documentation: Changing the service account and access scopes for an instance^]

. If you want to manage resources in other Google Cloud projects, grant access by adding the service account with the BlueXP role to that project. You'll need to repeat this step for each project.

.Result

BlueXP now has the permissions that it needs to perform actions in Google Cloud on your behalf.
