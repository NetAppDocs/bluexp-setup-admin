There are a few different ways to create a Connector in Azure. Directly from BlueXP is the most common way. The installation option that you choose determines how you prepare for deployment.

The following installation options are available:

* Create the Connector directly from BlueXP (this is the standard option)
+
This action launches a VM running Linux and the Connector software in a VNet of your choice.

* Create a Connector from the Azure Marketplace
+
This action also launches a VM running Linux and the Connector software.

* Download and manually install the software on your own Linux host

The installation option that you choose impacts how you prepare for installation. This includes how you provide BlueXP with the required permissions that it needs to authenticate and manage resources in Azure.
