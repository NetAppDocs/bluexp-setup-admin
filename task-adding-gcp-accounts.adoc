You can manage the credentials that are associated with the Connector VM instance.

== Associating a Marketplace subscription with GCP credentials

When you deploy a Connector in GCP, BlueXP creates a default set of credentials that are associated with the Connector VM instance. These are the credentials that Cloud MBlueXPo deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

At any time, you can change the Marketplace subscription that's associated with these credentials. The subscription enables you to create a pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, and to use other NetApp cloud services.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.

. Click the action menu for a set of credentials and then select *Associate Subscription*.

. Select a Google Cloud project and subscription from the down-down list.

. Click *Associate*.

. If you don't already have a subscription, click *Add Subscription* and follow the steps to create a new subscription below.
+
NOTE: Before you complete the following steps, ensure that you have both Billing Admin privileges in your Google Cloud account as well as a NetApp Cloud Central login.

. Reivew the subscription steps and click *Continue*.

+
NOTE: This step must be completed to link the GCP subscription to your NetApp account. The process of linking a subscription isn't complete until you are redirected from this page and then sign in to NetApp Cloud Central.

. After you're redirected to Cloud Central, log in to NetApp Cloud Central or sign up, and then click *Done* to proceed.
+
The GCP subscription will be linked to all NetApp accounts that your user login is associated with.

NOTE: If someone from your organization has already subscribed to the NetApp BlueXP subscription from your billing account, then you will be redirected to https://cloud.netapp.com/ontap-cloud?x-gcp-marketplace-token=[the Cloud Volumes ONTAP page on NetApp Cloud Central^] instead. If this is unexpected, contact your NetApp sales team. Google enables only one subscription per Google billing account.

. Once this process is complete, navigate back to the Credentials page in BlueXP and select this new subscription.

== Troubleshooting the Marketplace subscription process

Sometimes subscribing to Cloud Volumes ONTAP through the Google Cloud Marketplace can become fragmented due to incorrect permissions or accidentally not following the redirection to NetApp Cloud Central. If this happens, use the following steps to complete the subscription process.

.Steps

. Navigate to the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager[NetApp BlueXP page on the Google Cloud Marketplace^] to check on the state of the order. If the page states *Manage on Provider*, scroll down and click *Manage Orders*.
+

.. If the order shows a green check mark and this is unexpected, somebody else from the organization using the same billing account might already be subscribed. If this is unexpected or you require the details of this subscription, contact your NetApp sales team.

.. If the order shows a clock and *Pending* status, go back to the marketplace page and choose *Manage on Provider* to complete the process as documented above.
