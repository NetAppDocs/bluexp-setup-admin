BlueXP's identity and access management enables you to represent your organization's complete resource hierarchy using folders and projects. You can organize your resources according to your needs and assign resources at any level of your organization.

== Add a folder or project

You must create at least one project to allocate access to resources. Projects are the foundation of NetApp's identity access and management. You can optionally create folders to group related projects together.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option2.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. From the *Organization* page, select *Add folder or project*.

. Select *Folder* or *Project*.

. Provide details about the folder or project:
+
* *Name and location*: Enter a name and choose a location in the hierarchy for the folder or project. A folder or project can reside underneath the organization or within a folder.
* *Resources*: Select the resources that you want to associate with this folder or project.
* *Access*: Specify the organization members that should have access to the folder or project and then select a role for each member. The role defines the permissions that the member has within the folder or project. 

. Select *Add*.

.Result

BlueXP creates the folder or project and associates the specified resources and members.

== View the resources and members associated with a folder or project

. On the *Edit* page, select the following options:
+
* Select *Resources* to view the associated resources. In the table, the *Allocated* column identifies the resources that are allocated to the folder or project. 
* Select *Access* to view the members who have access to the folder or project.

.What's next?

If needed, you can change the associated resources or modify member access.

== Modify the resources associated with a folder or project

You can modify the resources that are associated with a folder or project by associating or disassociating a resource.

. On the *Edit* page, select *Resources*.
+
In the table, the *Allocated* column identifies the resources that are allocated to the folder or project.

. Select the resources that you'd like to associate or disassociate.
+
After you select one or more resources, the actions to *Associate resources* or *Disassociate resources* are available.

. Depending on the resources that you selected, select either *Associate resources* or *Disassociate resources*.

. Select *Apply*

BlueXP associates the resource with the folder or project.
