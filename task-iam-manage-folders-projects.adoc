BlueXP's identity and access management enables you to represent your organization's complete resource hierarchy using folders and projects. A _project_ represents a workspace in BlueXP that organization members access to manage _resources_ (for example, a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system). A _folder_ groups related projects together. After you organize your resources into folders and projects, you can grant granular access to resources by providing organization members with permissions to specific folders and projects.

== Add a folder or project

You must create at least one project that members can access to manage your organization's resources. You can optionally create folders to group related projects together.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option2.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. From the *Organization* page, select *Add folder or project*.

. Select *Folder* or *Project*.

. Provide details about the folder or project:
+
* *Name and location*: Enter a name and choose a location in the hierarchy for the folder or project. A folder or project can reside directly underneath the organization or within a folder.
* *Resources*: Select the resources that you want to associate with this folder or project. 
* *Access*: Specify the organization members who should have access to the folder or project and then select a role for each member. A role defines the permissions that members have for the folder or project. 

. Select *Add*.

.Result

BlueXP creates the folder or project and associates the specified resources and members.

== View the resources and members associated with a folder or project

To verify that your resources are organized appropriately and accessible to the right members in your organization, you can view which resources and members are associated with a folder or project.

.Steps

. From the *Organization* page, navigate to a project or folder in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Edit folder* or *Edit project*.

+

If needed, you can <<modify-resources,modify the associated resources>> or <<modify-members,modify member access>>.

[#modify-resources]
== Modify the resources associated with a folder or project

You can modify the resources that are associated with a folder or project by associating or disassociating a resource. For example, you might want to associate a resource with another project because that resource has capacity that another team can utilize.

.Steps

. From the *Organization* page, navigate to a project or folder in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Edit folder* or *Edit project*.

. On the *Edit* page, select *Resources*.
+
In the table, the *Allocated* column identifies the resources that are allocated to the folder or project.

. Select the resources that you'd like to associate or disassociate.

. Depending on the resources that you selected, select either *Associate resources* or *Disassociate resources*.
+

.Result

BlueXP associates the resource with the folder or project.

[#modify-members]
== Modify member access to a folder or project

Modify member access to a folder or project to ensure that the right users have access to the resources associated with the folder or project.

.Steps

. From the *Organization* page, navigate to a project or folder in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Edit folder* or *Edit project*.

. On the *Edit* page, select *Access*.
+
BlueXP displays the list of members who have access to the folder or project.

. Modify member access:
+
* *Add a member*: Select the member that you'd like to add to the folder or project and assign them a role.
* *Change a user's role*: For any members with a role other than Organization Admin, select their existing role and then choose a new role.
* *Remove member access*: ?

. Select *Apply*.

* The folder or project must not have any associated resources. <<modify-resources,Learn how to disassociate resources>>.
* A folder must not contain any subfolders or projects. You need to delete those folders and projects first.

. Confirm that you want to delete the folder or project.

BlueXP deletes the folder or project. That folder or project is no longer available to organization members.
