BlueXP's identity and access management enables you to represent a complete resource hierarchy using folders and projects. You can organize your company resources according to your needs and assign resources at any level of your organization.

== Add a folder or project

You must create at least one project to allocate access to resources. Projects are the foundation of NetApp identity access and management. You can optionally create folders to group related projects.
