.What you'll need

* An AWS authentication method: either an IAM role or access keys for an IAM user with the required permissions.
+
link:task-set-up-permissions-aws.html[Learn how to set up AWS permissions]

* A VPC and subnet that meets networking requirements.
+
link:task-set-up-networking-aws.html[Learn about networking requirements]

* A key pair for the EC2 instance.

* Details about a proxy server, if a proxy is required for internet access from the Connector.

.Steps

. Click the *Connector* drop-down and select *Add Connector*.
+

. Choose *Amazon Web Services* as your cloud provider and click *Continue*.

. On the *Deploying a Connector* page, review the details about what you'll need. You have two options:

.. Click *Continue* to prepare for deployment by using the in-product guide. Each step in the in-product guide includes the information that's contained on this page of the documentation.

.. Click *Skip to Deployment* if you already prepared by following the steps on this page.

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the Connector:

* *Get Ready*: Review what you'll need.

* *AWS Credentials*: Specify your AWS region and then choose an authentication method, which is either an IAM role that BlueXP can assume or an AWS access key and secret key.
+
TIP: If you choose *Assume Role*, you can create the first set of credentials from the Connector deployment wizard. Any additional set of credentials must be created from the Credentials page. They will then be available from the wizard in a drop-down list. link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html[Learn how to add additional credentials].

* *Details*: Provide details about the Connector.
+
** Enter a name for the instance.
** Add custom tags (metadata) to the instance.
** Choose whether you want BlueXP to create a new role that has the required permissions, or if you want to select an existing role that you set up with link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the required permissions].
** Choose whether you want to encrypt the Connector's EBS disks. You have the option to use the default encryption key or to use a custom key.

* *Network*: Specify a VPC, subnet, and key pair for the instance, choose whether to enable a public IP address, and optionally specify a proxy configuration.
+
Make sure that you have the correct key pair to use with the Connector. Without a key pair, you will not be able to access the Connector virtual machine.

* *Security Group*: Choose whether to create a new security group or whether to select an existing security group that allows the required inbound and outbound rules.
+
link:reference-ports-aws.html[View security group rules for AWS].

* *Review*: Review your selections to verify that your set up is correct.

. Click *Add*.
+
The instance should be ready in about 7 minutes. You should stay on the page until the process is complete.

.Result

After the process is complete, the Connector is available for use from BlueXP.

.AWS Marketplace

.What you'll need

* A VPC and subnet that meets networking requirements.
+
link:task-set-up-networking-aws.html[Learn about networking requirements].

* An IAM role with an attached policy that includes the required permissions for the Connector.
+
link:task-set-up-permissions-aws.html[Learn how to set up AWS permissions].

* Permissions to subscribe and unsubscribe from the AWS Marketplace for your IAM user.

* A key pair for the EC2 instance.

.Steps

. Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B018REK8QG[BlueXP page on the AWS Marketplace^]

. On the Marketplace page, click *Continue to Subscribe* and then click *Continue to Configuration*.
+
image:screenshot-subscribe-aws.png[A screenshot that shows the Continue to Subscribe and Continue to Configuration buttons on the AWS Marketplace.]

. Change any of the default options and click *Continue to Launch*.

. Under *Choose Action*, select *Launch through EC2* and then click *Launch*.
+
These steps describe how to launch the instance from the EC2 Console because the console enables you to attach an IAM role to the Connector instance. This isn't possible using the *Launch from Website* action.

. Follow the prompts to configure and deploy the instance:

* *Name and tags*: Enter a name and tags for the instance.

* *Application and OS Image*: Skip this section. The Connector AMI is already selected.

* *Instance type*: Depending on region availability, choose one of the supported instance types (t3.xlarge is recommended).
+
link:reference-host-requirements-aws.html[Review the instance requirements].

* *Key pair (login)*: Select the key pair that you want to use to securely connect to the instance.

* *Network settings*: Edit the network settings as needed:
+
** Choose the desired VPC and subnet.
** Specify whether the instance should have a public IP address.
** Specify firewall settings that enable the required connection methods for the Connector instance: SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
+
A few more rule are required for specific configurations.
+
link:reference-ports-aws.html[View security group rules for AWS].

* *Configure storage*: Keep the default storage options.

* *Advanced details*: Under *IAM instance profile*, choose the IAM role that includes the required permissions for the Connector.
+
link:task-set-up-permissions-aws.html[Learn how to set up AWS permissions].

* *Summary*: Review the summary and click *Launch instance*.

+
AWS launches the software with the specified settings. The Connector instance and software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector virtual machine and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:
.. Specify the BlueXP account to associate with the Connector.
.. Enter a name for the system.
.. Under *Are you running in a secured environment?* keep restricted mode disabled.
+
You should keep restricted mode disabled because these steps describe how to use BlueXP in standard mode. You should enable restricted mode only if you have a secure environment and want to disconnect this account from BlueXP backend services. If that's the case, link:task-quick-start-restricted-mode.html[follow steps to get started with BlueXP in restricted mode].
.. Click *Let's start*.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your BlueXP account.

Open a web browser and go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] to start using the Connector with BlueXP.
