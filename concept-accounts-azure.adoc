Learn how BlueXP uses Azure credentials and permissions to perform actions on your behalf. Understanding these details can be helpful as you manage the credentials for one or more Azure subscriptions. For example, you might want to learn when to add additional Azure credentials to BlueXP.

== Initial Azure credentials

When you deploy a Connector from BlueXP, you need to use an Azure account or service principal that has permissions to deploy the Connector virtual machine. The required permissions are listed in the link:task-set-up-permissions-azure.html[Connector deployment policy for Azure].

When BlueXP deploys the Connector virtual machine in Azure, it enables a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[system-assigned managed identity^] on virtual machine, creates a custom role, and assigns it to the virtual machine. The role provides BlueXP with the permissions required to manage resources and processes within that Azure subscription. link:reference-permissions-azure.html[Review how BlueXP uses the permissions].

BlueXP selects these Azure credentials by default when you create a new working environment for Cloud Volumes ONTAP:

You can deploy all of your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems using the initial Azure credentials, or you can add additional credentials.

== Additional Azure subscriptions for a managed identity

The system-assigned managed identity assigned to the Connector VM is associated with the subscription in which you launched the Connector. If you want to select a different Azure subscription, then you need to link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html#associating-additional-azure-subscriptions-with-a-managed-identity[associate the managed identity with those subscriptions].

== Additional Azure credentials

If you want to use different Azure credentials with BlueXP, then you must grant the required permissions by link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html[creating and setting up a service principal in Azure Active Directory] for each Azure account. The following image shows two additional accounts, each set up with a service principal and custom role that provides permissions:

image:diagram_permissions_multiple_azure.png["A conceptual image that shows the initial Azure account, which receives permissions through a custom role and managed identity, and two additional accounts that receive permissions through a custom role and service principal."]

You would then link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html#adding-azure-accounts-to-cloud-manager[add the account credentials to BlueXP] by providing details about the AD service principal.

For example, you can switch between credentials when creating a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment:

== What about Marketplace deployments and on-prem deployments?

The sections above describe the recommended deployment method for the Connector, which is from BlueXP. You can also deploy a Connector in Azure from the Azure Marketplace, and you can install the Connector software on your own Linux host.

If you use the Marketplace, you can provide permissions by assigning a custom role to the Connector VM and to a system-assigned managed identity, or you can use Azure AD service principal.

For on-premises deployments, you can't set up a managed identity for the Connector, but you can provide permissions by using a service principal.
