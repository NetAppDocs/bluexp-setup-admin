Learn how BlueXP uses Azure credentials to perform actions on your behalf and how those credentials are associated with marketplace subscriptions. Understanding these details can be helpful as you manage the credentials for one or more Azure subscriptions. For example, you might want to learn when to add additional Azure credentials to BlueXP.

== Initial Azure credentials

When you deploy a Connector from BlueXP, you need to use an Azure account or service principal that has permissions to deploy the Connector virtual machine. The required permissions are listed in the link:task-install-connector-azure-bluexp.html#connector-custom-role[Connector deployment policy for Azure].

When BlueXP deploys the Connector virtual machine in Azure, it enables a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[system-assigned managed identity^] on the virtual machine, creates a custom role, and assigns it to the virtual machine. The role provides BlueXP with the permissions required to manage resources and processes within that Azure subscription. link:reference-permissions-azure.html[Review how BlueXP uses the permissions].

If you create a new working environment for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, BlueXP selects these Azure credentials by default:

You can deploy all of your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems using the initial Azure credentials, or you can add additional credentials.

== Additional Azure subscriptions for a managed identity

The system-assigned managed identity assigned to the Connector VM is associated with the subscription in which you launched the Connector. If you want to select a different Azure subscription, then you need to link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html#associate-additional-azure-subscriptions-with-a-managed-identity[associate the managed identity with those subscriptions].

== Additional Azure credentials

If you want to use different Azure credentials with BlueXP, then you must grant the required permissions by link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html[creating and setting up a service principal in Microsoft Entra ID] for each Azure account. The following image shows two additional accounts, each set up with a service principal and custom role that provides permissions:

image:diagram_permissions_multiple_azure.png["A conceptual image that shows the initial Azure account, which receives permissions through a custom role and managed identity, and two additional accounts that receive permissions through a custom role and service principal."]

You would then link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html#add-additional-azure-credentials-to-bluexp[add the account credentials to BlueXP] by providing details about the AD service principal.

For example, you can switch between credentials when creating a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment:

image:screenshot_accounts_switch_azure.gif["A screenshot that shows selecting between cloud provider accounts after selecting Switch Account in the Details & Credentials page."]

== Credentials and marketplace subscriptions

The credentials that you add to a Connector must be associated with an Azure Marketplace subscription so that you can pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP at an hourly rate (PAYGO) or through an annual contract, and to use other BlueXP services.

link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html#subscribe[Learn how to associate an Azure subscription].

Note the following about Azure credentials and marketplace subscriptions:

* You can associate only one Azure Marketplace subscription with a set of Azure credentials
* You can replace an existing marketplace subscription with a new subscription

== FAQ

The following question is related to credentials and subscriptions.

=== Can I change the Azure Marketplace subscription for Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments?

Yes, you can. When you change the Azure Marketplace subscription that's associated with a set of Azure credentials, all existing and new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments will be charged against the new subscription.

link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html#subscribe[Learn how to associate an Azure subscription].

=== Can I add multiple Azure credentials, each with different marketplace subscriptions?

All Azure credentials that belong to the same Azure subscription will be associated with the same Azure Marketplace subscription.

If you have multiple Azure credentials that belong to different Azure subscriptions, then those credentials can be associated with the same Azure Marketplace subscription or with different marketplace subscriptions.

=== Can I move existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments to a different Azure subscription?

No, it's not possible to move the Azure resources associated with your Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment to a different Azure subscription.

=== How do credentials work for marketplace deployments and on-prem deployments?

The sections above describe the recommended deployment method for the Connector, which is from BlueXP. You can also deploy a Connector in Azure from the Azure Marketplace, and you can install the Connector software on your own Linux host.

If you use the Marketplace, you can provide permissions by assigning a custom role to the Connector VM and to a system-assigned managed identity, or you can use a Microsoft Entra service principal.

For on-premises deployments, you can't set up a managed identity for the Connector, but you can provide permissions by using a service principal.
