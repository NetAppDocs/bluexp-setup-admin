You should understand how BlueXP uses AWS credentials and permissions so that you can manage credentials for one or more AWS accounts.

== Initial AWS credentials

When you deploy a Connector from BlueXP, you need to provide the ARN of an IAM role or access keys for an IAM user. The authentication method that you use must have the required permissions to deploy the Connector instance in AWS. The required permissions are listed in the link:task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Connector deployment policy for AWS].

When BlueXP launches the Connector instance in AWS, it creates an IAM role and an instance profile for the instance. It also attaches a policy that provides the Connector with permissions to manage resources and processes within that AWS account. link:reference-permissions-aws.html[Review how BlueXP uses the permissions].

BlueXP selects these AWS credentials by default when you create a new working environment for Cloud Volumes ONTAP:

You can deploy all of your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems using the initial AWS credentials, or you can add additional credentials.

== Additional AWS credentials

There are two ways to add additional AWS credentials:

* You can add AWS credentials to an existing Connector
* You can add AWS credentials directly to BlueXP

Review the sections below for more details.

=== Add AWS credentials to an existing Connector

If you want to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in different AWS accounts, then you can either link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html[provide AWS keys for an IAM user or the ARN of a role in a trusted account]. The following image shows two additional accounts, one providing permissions through an IAM role in a trusted account and another through the AWS keys of an IAM user:

image:diagram_permissions_multiple_aws.png["A conceptual image that shows two additional accounts. Each has an IAM policy, one is attached to IAM user and the other is attached to an IAM role."]

You would then link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html#adding-aws-accounts-to-cloud-manager[add the account credentials to BlueXP] by specifying the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role, or the AWS keys for the IAM user.

After you add another set of credentials, you can switch to them when creating a new working environment:

=== Add AWS credentials directly to BlueXP

Adding new AWS credentials to BlueXP provides the permissions needed to create and manage an FSx for ONTAP working environment or to create a Connector.

== What about Marketplace deployments and on-prem deployments?

The sections above describe the recommended deployment method for the Connector, which is from BlueXP. You can also deploy a Connector in AWS from the AWS Marketplace and you can manually install the Connector software on your own Linux host.

If you use the Marketplace, permissions are provided in the same way. You just need to manually create and set up the IAM role, and then provide permissions for any additional accounts.

For on-premises deployments, you can't set up an IAM role for the BlueXP system, but you can provide permissions using AWS access keys.

== How can I securely rotate my AWS credentials?

As described above, BlueXP enables you to provide AWS credentials in a few ways: an IAM role associated with the Connector instance, by assuming an IAM role in a trusted account, or by providing AWS access keys.

With the first two options, BlueXP uses the AWS Security Token Service to obtain temporary credentials that rotate constantly. This process is the best practice--it's automatic and it's secure.

If you provide BlueXP with AWS access keys, you should rotate the keys by updating them in BlueXP at a regular interval. This is a completely manual process.
