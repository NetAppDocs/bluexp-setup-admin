After you install and set up the Connector, you need to add your cloud credentials so that BlueXP has the required permissions to perform actions in AWS or Azure.

TIP: Why not Google Cloud? When the Connector is installed on your premises, it can't manage your resources in Google Cloud. The Connector must be installed in Google Cloud to manage any resources that resides there.
