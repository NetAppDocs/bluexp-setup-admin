Depending on the actions that you've taken in BlueXP, you might have associated ONTAP credentials and NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials with your BlueXP user login. You can view and manage those credentials in BlueXP after you've associated them. For example, if you change the password for these credentials, then you'll need to update the password in BlueXP.

== ONTAP credentials 

Whether or not BlueXP prompts you for ONTAP credentials depends on how BlueXP is set up.

When using BlueXP without a Connector, you are prompted to enter your ONTAP credentials to discover an on-premises ONTAP cluster and to access the Advanced view (ONTAP System manager) of the cluster. You can choose to save these credentials in BlueXP which means you won't be prompted to enter them each time. You can update these on the User credentials page. Your ONTAP credentials are only visible to you. 

When using a Connector, BlueXP does not prompt you to enter their ONTAP credentials to discover clusters. By default, you can also access the Advanced view (ONTAP System Manager). However, your BlueXP administrator can configure BlueXP to prompt you enter your ONTAP credentials to ensure you have the right permissions to manage your ONTAP clusters. When this setting is enabled, you need to enter your ONTAP credentials each time and you cannot store them in BlueXP.


== NSS credentials

The NSS credentials associated with your BlueXP login enable support registration, case management, and access to Digital Advisor.

* When you access *Support > Resources* and register for support, you're prompted to associate NSS credentials with your BlueXP login.
+
This action registers the BlueXP organization or account for support and activates support entitlement. Only one user in your BlueXP organization or account must associate a NetApp Support Site account with their BlueXP login to register for support and activate support entitlement. After this is completed, the *Resources* page shows that your account is registered for support.

* When you access *Support > Case Management*, you're prompted to enter your NSS credentials, if you haven't already done so. This page enables you to create and manage the support cases associated with your NSS account and with your company.

* When you access Digital Advisor in BlueXP, you're prompted to log in to Digital Advisor by entering your NSS credentials.

Note the following about the NSS account associated with your BlueXP login:

* The account is managed at the user level, which means it isn't viewable by other users who log in.

* There can be only one NSS account associated with Digital Advisor and support case management, per user.

* If you're trying to associate a NetApp Support Site account with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, you can only choose from the NSS accounts that were added to the BlueXP organization or account that you are a member of.
+
NSS account-level credentials are different than the NSS account that's associated with your BlueXP login. NSS account-level credentials enable you to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP when you bring your own license (BYOL), register PAYGO systems, and upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP software.
