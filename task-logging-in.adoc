[.lead]
BlueXP is accessible from your web browser through a SaaS-based user interface.

If you're accessing BlueXP from a Government region or a site that doesn't have outbound internet access, then you need to log in to the BlueXP user interface that runs locally on the Connector. link:task-managing-connectors.html#access-the-local-ui[Learn how to access the local UI on the Connector].

.Login options

You can log in to BlueXP using one of the following options:

* Your existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials
+
When you use this option, your NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials are not added to BlueXP in the Support Dashboard. Adding your NSS credentials to BlueXP is required to enable key workflows for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. link:task-adding-nss-accounts.html[Learn how to add your NSS credentials to BlueXP].

* A NetApp cloud login using your email address and a password
+
This option supports federated connections. You can use single sign-on to log in using credentials from your corporate directory (federated identity). To learn more, go to the https://cloud.netapp.com/help-center[BlueXP Help Center^] and then click *sign-in options*.

Each time that you log in, you'll need to use the same option that you chose when you logged in for the first time.

* If you registered by logging in with your NetApp Support Site credentials, then you need to use that log in option each time.
* If you signed up by entering your email and password, then you need to enter those credentials each time that you log in.

.Steps

. Open a web browser and go to the https://cloudmanager.netapp.com[BlueXP console^]
