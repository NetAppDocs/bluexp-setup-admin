NetApp BlueXP provides your organization with a single control plane that helps you build, protect, and govern data across your on-premises and cloud environments. The BlueXP software as a service (SaaS) platform includes services that provide storage management, data mobility, data protection, and data analysis and control. Management capabilities are provided through a web-based console and APIs.

== Features

BlueXP provides unified control of storage across your hybrid multicloud and integrated data services to protect, secure, and optimize data.

=== Unified control of storage from the BlueXP canvas

The _BlueXP canvas_ lets you discover, deploy, and manage cloud and on-premises storage. The canvas centralizes storage management.

==== Supported cloud and on-premises storage

BlueXP enables you to manage the following types of storage from the BlueXP canvas:

Cloud storage solutions::
* Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP
* Azure NetApp Files
* Cloud Volumes ONTAP
* Google Cloud NetApp Volumes

On-premises flash and object storage::
* E-Series systems
* ONTAP clusters
* StorageGRID systems

Cloud object storage::
* Amazon S3 storage
* Azure Blob storage
* Google Cloud Storage

==== Storage management from working environments

On the BlueXP canvas, _working environments_ represent discovered or deployed storage. You can select a _working environment_ to integrate it with BlueXP data services or manage storage, such as adding volumes.

== How BlueXP works

BlueXP includes a web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer, a resource and access management system, Connectors that manage working environments and enable BlueXP cloud services, and different deployment modes to meet your business requirements.

=== Software-as-a-service

BlueXP is accessible through a https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[web-based console^] and APIs. This SaaS experience enables you to automatically access the latest features as they're released and to easily switch between your BlueXP organizations, projects, and Connectors.

=== BlueXP identity and access management (IAM)

BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) is a resource and access management model that provides granular management of resources and permissions:

* A top-level _organization_ enables you to manage access across your various _projects_
* _Folders_ enable you to group related projects together
* Resource management enables you to associate a resource with one or more folders or projects
* Access management enables you to assign a role to members at different levels of the organization hierarchy

BlueXP IAM is supported when using BlueXP in standard or restricted mode. If you're using BlueXP in private mode, then you use a BlueXP _account_ to manage workspaces, users, and resources.

=== Connectors

You don't need a Connector to get started with BlueXP, but you'll need to create a Connector to unlock all BlueXP features and services. A Connector enables you to manage resources and processes across your on-premises and cloud environments. You need it to manage working environments (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP) and to use many BlueXP services.

=== Deployment modes

BlueXP offers three deployment modes. _Standard mode_ leverages the BlueXP software as a service (SaaS) layer to provide full functionality. If your environment has security and connectivity restrictions, _restricted mode_ and _private mode_ limit outbound connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS layer.
