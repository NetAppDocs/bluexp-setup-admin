== How BlueXP works

BlueXP includes a web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer, accounts that provide multi-tenancy, and Connectors that manage working environments and enable BlueXP cloud services.

=== Software-as-a-service

BlueXP is accessible through a https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[web-based console^] and APIs. This SaaS experience enables you to automatically access the latest features as they're released and to easily switch between your BlueXP accounts and Connectors.

=== BlueXP account

When you log in to BlueXP for the first time, you're prompted to create a _BlueXP account_. This account provides multi-tenancy and enables you to organize users and resources in isolated _workspaces_.

=== Connectors

You don't need a Connector to get started with BlueXP, but you'll need to create a Connector to unlock all BlueXP features and services. A Connector enables the management of resources and processes across your on-premises and cloud environments. It's required to manage working environments (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP clusters) and to use many BlueXP data services.

=== Restricted mode and private mode 

BlueXP is also supported in environments that have security and connectivity restrictions. You can use _restricted mode_ or _private mode_ to limit outbound connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS layer.

== SOC 2 Type 2 certification

An independent certified public accountant firm and services auditor examined BlueXP and affirmed that it achieved SOC 2 Type 2 reports based on the applicable Trust Services criteria.
