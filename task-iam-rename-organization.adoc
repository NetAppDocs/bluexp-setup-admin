Your BlueXP organization has a name and an ID. You can choose a name for your organization to help identify it in your BlueXP deployment. You may also need to retrieve the organization ID for certain integrations such as Keystone.

== Rename your organization

You can rename your organization within BlueXP. This is helpful if you support more than organization within your BlueXP deployment.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. From the *Organization* page, navigate to the first row in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Edit organization*.

== Get the organization ID

The organization ID is used for certain integrations with BlueXP. In particular, you'll need the organization ID if you want to configure BlueXP to be a cloud mediator for your ONTAP on-premises resources. 

You can view the organization ID from the Organizations page and copy it to the clipboard for your needs.
