BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) includes predefined roles that you can assign to the members of your organization across different levels of your resource hierarchy. Before you assign these roles, you should understand the permissions that each role includes. Roles fall into the following categories: platform, application, and data service.


[#platform-roles]
== Platform roles
Platform roles grant all permissions for BlueXP administration, including assigning roles and adding users. Users with platform roles have access to all data services and applications within BlueXP. BlueXP IAM includes two platform roles: Organization admin and Folder or project admin. The main difference between the two BlueXP IAM platform roles is scope.
