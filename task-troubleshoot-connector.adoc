== Find the system ID for a Connector

To help you get started, your NetApp representative might ask you for the system ID of your Connector. The ID is typically used for licensing and troubleshooting purposes.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Help icon.

. Select *Support > BlueXP Connector*.
+
The system ID appears at the top of the page.
+

== View a Connector's version

You can view the version of your Connector to verify that the Connector automatically upgraded to the latest release or because you need to share it with your NetApp representative.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Help icon.

. Select *Support > BlueXP Connector*.
+
The version displays at the top of the page.

== Download or send an AutoSupport message

If you're having problems, NetApp personnel might ask you to send an AutoSupport message to NetApp support for troubleshooting purposes.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Help icon, and select *Support*.
+

. Select *BlueXP Connector*.

. Depending on how you need to send the information to NetApp support, choose one of the following options:

.. Select the option to download the AutoSupport message to your local machine. You can then send it to NetApp Support using a preferred method.

.. Select *Send AutoSupport* to directly send the message to NetApp Support.

+
NOTE: When you choose to have to have BlueXP send the AutoSupport message, it can take up to five hours because BlueXP automatically load balances when AutoSupport messages are sent. If your communication with NetApp support is time-sensitive, you should download the file and send to NetApp support yourself.

== Fix download failures when using a Google Cloud NAT gateway

The Connector automatically downloads software updates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. The download can fail if your configuration uses a Google Cloud NAT gateway. You can correct this issue by limiting the number of parts that the software image is divided into. This step must be completed by using the BlueXP API.

.Step

.	Submit a PUT request to /occm/config with the following JSON as body:
+
[source.json]
{
  "maxDownloadSessions": 32
}
+
The value for _maxDownloadSessions_ can be 1 or any integer greater than 1. If the value is 1, then the downloaded image will not be divided.
+
Note that 32 is an example value. The value that you should use depends on your NAT configuration and the number of sessions that you can have simultaneously.
