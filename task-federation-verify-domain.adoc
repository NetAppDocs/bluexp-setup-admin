If you want to federate with a domain that is different than your email domain, you must first verify that you own the domain. You can only use verified domains for federation.

Verifying your domain involves adding a TXT record to your domain's DNS settings. This record is used to prove that you own the domain and allows BlueXP to trust the domain for federation.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[Settings icon] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select *Federations*.

. Select *Verify domain ownership*.
. Enter the domain that you want to verify and select *Continue*.
. Copy the TXT record that is provided.
. Go to your domain's DNS settings and add the TXT record that you copied in the previous step.
. After you have added the TXT record, return to BlueXP and select *Verify*.
