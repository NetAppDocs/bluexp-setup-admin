To manually install the Connector on your own Linux host, you need to review host requirements, set up your networking, prepare Azure permissions, install the Connector, and then provide the permissions that you prepared.

.Before you begin

You should review link:reference-limitations.html[Connector limitations].

== Step 1: Review host requirements

The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on.

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=dedicated]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=os]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=hypervisor]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=cpu-ram]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=azure-vm]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=disk-space]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=docker]

== Step 2: Set up networking

Ensure that the network location where you plan to install the Connector supports the following requirements. Meeting these requirements enables the Connector to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.

//Azure regions
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=azure-region]

//Connections to target networks
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=networks]

//Outbound internet access
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=outbound]

//Endpoints contacted during manual installation
include::_include/endpoints-manual-install.adoc[tag=endpoint-list]

include::_include/endpoints-manual-install.adoc[tag=update]

//Endpoints contacted from the Connector

== Step 3: Set up permissions

You need to provide Azure permissions to BlueXP by using one of the following options:

* Option 1: Assign a custom role to the Azure VM using a system-assigned managed identity.

* Option 2: Provide BlueXP with the credentials for an Azure service principal that has the required permissions.

Follow the steps to prepare permissions for BlueXP.

.Custom role
--
Note that you can create an Azure custom role using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. The following steps show how to create the role using the Azure CLI. If you would prefer to use a different method, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role[Azure documentation^]

.Steps 

. If you're planning to manually install the software on your own host, enable a system-assigned managed identity on the VM so that you can provide the required Azure permissions through a custom role.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm[Microsoft Azure documentation: Configure managed identities for Azure resources on a VM using the Azure portal^]

include::_include/azure-set-up-role.adoc[]
--

.Service principal
--
Create and set up a service principal in Azure Active Directory and obtain the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs.

.Create an Azure Active Directory application for role-based access control

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=app]

.Assign the application to a role
 
include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=role]

.Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=api]

.Get the application ID and directory ID for the application

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=ids]

.Create a client secret

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tags=secret]

.Result

Your service principal is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you add an Azure account.

== Step 4: Install the Connector

After the pre-requisites are complete, you can manually install the software on your own Linux host.

include::_include/manual-install.adoc[tag=before]

* A managed identity enabled on the VM in Azure so that you can provide the required Azure permissions through a custom role.

include::_include/manual-install.adoc[tag=main-steps]

include::_include/manual-install.adoc[tag=standard-mode-steps-for-cloud]

== Step 5: Provide permissions to BlueXP

Now that you've installed the Connector, you need to provide BlueXP with the Azure permissions that you previously set up. Providing the permissions enables BlueXP to manage your data and storage infrastructure in Azure.

// start tabbed area

.Custom role

include::_include/azure-provide-permissions-role.adoc[]

.What's next?

Go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] to start using the Connector with BlueXP.
--

.Service principal
--
.Steps

include::_include/azure-provide-permissions-service-principal.adoc[]

.Result

BlueXP now has the permissions that it needs to perform actions in Azure on your behalf.
