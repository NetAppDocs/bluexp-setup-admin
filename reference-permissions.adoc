To use BlueXP features and services, you'll need to provide permissions so that BlueXP can perform operations in your cloud environment. Use the links on this page to quickly access the permissions that you need based on your goal.

== AWS permissions

BlueXP requires AWS permissions for the Connector and for individual services.

=== Connectors

[cols=3*,options="header",cols="20,60,20"]
|===
| Goal
| Description
| Link

| Deploy the Connector from BlueXP
| The user who creates a Connector from BlueXP needs specific permissions to deploy the instance in AWS.
| link:task-set-up-permissions-aws.html[Set up AWS permissions]

| Provide permissions for the Connector
| When BlueXP launches the Connector, it attaches a policy to the instance that provides the permissions required to manage resources and processes in your AWS account.

You need to set up the policy yourself if you launch a Connector from the AWS Marketplace, if you manually install the Connector, or if you link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html#add-additional-credentials-to-a-connector[add more AWS credentials to a Connector].

You also need to ensure that the policy is up to date as new permissions are added in subsequent releases.

| Goal
| Description
| Link

| Provide permissions for Cloud Volumes ONTAP nodes
| An IAM role must be attached to each Cloud Volumes ONTAP node in AWS. The same is true for the HA mediator. The default option is to let BlueXP create the IAM roles for you, but you can use your own when creating the working environment.
