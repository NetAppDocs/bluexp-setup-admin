| Connector deployment
| The user who creates a Connector from BlueXP needs specific permissions to deploy the instance in AWS.
| link:task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Create a Connector in AWS from BlueXP]

| Connector operation
| When BlueXP launches the Connector, it attaches a policy to the instance that provides the permissions required to manage resources and processes in your AWS account.

You need to set up the policy yourself if you link:task-launching-aws-mktp.html[launch a Connector from the marketplace] or if you link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html#add-credentials-to-a-connector[add more AWS credentials to a Connector].

You also need to ensure that the policy is up to date as new permissions are added in subsequent releases.

| Cloud Volumes ONTAP operation
| An IAM role must be attached to each Cloud Volumes ONTAP node in AWS. The same is true for the HA mediator. The default option is to let BlueXP create the IAM roles for you, but you can use your own.
