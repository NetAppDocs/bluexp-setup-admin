| Connector deployment from BlueXP
| The user who creates a Connector from BlueXP needs specific permissions to deploy the instance in AWS.
| link:task-set-up-permissions-aws.html[Set up AWS permissions]

| Connector operation
| When BlueXP launches the Connector, it attaches a policy to the instance that provides the permissions required to manage resources and processes in your AWS account.

You need to set up the policy yourself if you launch a Connector from the marketplace, manually install the Connector, or if you link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html#add-additional-credentials-to-a-connector[add more AWS credentials to a Connector].

You also need to ensure that the policy is up to date as new permissions are added in subsequent releases.

| Cloud Volumes ONTAP operation
| An IAM role must be attached to each Cloud Volumes ONTAP node in AWS. The same is true for the HA mediator. The default option is to let BlueXP create the IAM roles for you, but you can use your own.

| Back up on-premises ONTAP clusters to Amazon S3
| When activating backups on your ONTAP volumes, BlueXP backup and recovery prompts you to enter an access key and secret for an IAM user that has specific permissions.
| https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/task-backup-onprem-to-aws.html#set-up-s3-permissions[Set up S3 permissions^]

| Back up on-premises ONTAP clusters to StorageGRID
| When you prepare StorageGRID as a backup target for ONTAP clusters, BlueXP backup and recovery prompts you to enter an access key and secret for an IAM user that has specific permissions.
| https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/task-backup-onprem-private-cloud.html#prepare-storagegrid-as-your-backup-target[Prepare StorageGRID as your backup target^]

| Tier on-premises ONTAP clusters to AWS
| When you enable BlueXP tiering to AWS, the wizard prompts you to enter an access key and secret key. These credentials are passed to the ONTAP cluster so that ONTAP can tier data to the S3 bucket.

| Tier on-premises ONTAP clusters to StorageGRID
| When you set up BlueXP tiering to StorageGRID, you need to provide BlueXP tiering with an S3 access key and secret key. BlueXP tiering uses the keys to access your buckets.
