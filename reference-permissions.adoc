| Description

| Connector deployment | link:task-creating-connectors-aws.html[View the step-by-step instructions where the permissions are listed] | The user who creates a Connector from Cloud Manager needs specific permissions to deploy the instance in AWS.

| Connector operation | link:reference-permissions-aws.html[View AWS permissions for the Connector] | When Cloud Manager launches the Connector instance in AWS, it automatically attaches a policy to the instance that provides the Connector with permissions to manage resources and processes within that AWS account.

There are a few cases where you might need to create this IAM policy yourself:

* You're creating a Connector directly from the AWS Marketplace

| Cloud Volumes ONTAP operation | https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-set-up-iam-roles.html[Learn how to set up IAM roles yourself^] | An IAM role with the required permissions must be attached to each Cloud Volumes ONTAP node in AWS. The same is true for the HA mediator. It's easiest to let Cloud Manager create the IAM roles for you, but you can use your own roles. Using your own IAM role is required in the AWS Commercial Cloud Services Environment.
