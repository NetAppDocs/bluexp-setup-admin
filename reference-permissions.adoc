In order to use the features and services in Cloud Manager, you'll need to provide permissions so that Cloud Manager can perform operations in your cloud environment. Use the links on this page to quickly access the permissions that you need based on your goal.

| Connector deployment
| The user who creates a Connector from Cloud Manager needs specific permissions to deploy the instance in AWS
| link:task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Create a Connector in AWS from Cloud Manager]

| Connector operation
a| When Cloud Manager launches the Connector, it attaches a policy to the instance that provides the permissions required to manage resources and processes within the AWS account.

There are a few cases where you might need to create this IAM policy yourself:

* link:task-launching-aws-mktp.html[You're creating a Connector directly from the AWS Marketplace]

* link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html#add-credentials-to-a-connector[You're adding an additional set of AWS credentials to a Connector]

| link:reference-permissions-aws.html[AWS permissions for the Connector]

| Cloud Volumes ONTAP operation
| An IAM role with the required permissions must be attached to each Cloud Volumes ONTAP node in AWS. The same is true for the HA mediator. The default option is to let Cloud Manager create the IAM roles for you, but you can use your own roles.

| Connector operation
a| When Cloud Manager deploys the Connector VM in Azure, it creates a custom role that provides the permissions required to manage resources and processes within that Azure subscription.

There are a few cases where you might need to create this custom role yourself:
