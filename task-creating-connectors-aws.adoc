An Account Admin needs to deploy a _Connector_ before you can use most Cloud Manager features. The Connector enables Cloud Manager to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. link:concept-connectors.html[Learn when a Connector is required].

This page describes how to create a Connector in AWS directly from Cloud Manager. link:concept-connectors.html#how-to-create-a-connector[Learn about other ways to deploy a Connector].

These steps must be completed by a user who has the Account Admin role. A Workspace Admin can't create a Connector.

== Set up AWS authentication

Cloud Manager needs to authenticate with AWS before it can deploy the Connector instance in your VPC. You can choose one of these authentication methods:

* Let Cloud Manager assume an IAM role that has the required permissions
* Provide an AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user who has the required permissions

With either option, you first need to start by creating an IAM policy that includes the required permissions.

=== Create an IAM policy

This policy contains only the permissions needed to launch the Connector instance in AWS from Cloud Manager. Don't use this policy for other situations.

When Cloud Manager creates the Connector, it applies a new set of permissions to the Connector instance that enables the Connector to manage the resources in your public cloud environment.

.Steps

. Go to the AWS IAM console.

. Click *Policies > Create policy*.

. Click *JSON*.

. Copy and paste the following policy:
+
[source,json]
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{

            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:TerminateInstances"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "ec2:ResourceTag/OCCMInstance": "*"
                }
            },
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

. Click *Next* and add tags, if needed.

. Click *Next* and enter a name and description.

. Click *Create policy*.

.What's next?

Either attach the policy to an IAM role that Cloud Manager can assume or to an IAM user.

=== Set up an IAM role

Set up an IAM role that Cloud Manager can assume in order to deploy the Connector in AWS.

.Steps

. Go to the AWS IAM console in the target account.

. Under Access Management, click *Roles > Create Role* and follow the steps to create the role.
+
Be sure to do the following:

* Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.
* Select *Another AWS account* and enter the ID of the Cloud Manager SaaS account: 952013314444
* Select the policy that you created in the previous section.

. After you create the role, copy the Role ARN so that you can paste it in Cloud Manager when you create the Connector.

.Result

The IAM role now has the required permissions.

=== Set up permissions for an IAM user

When you create a Connector, you can provide an AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user who has the required permissions to deploy the Connector instance.

.Steps

. From the AWS IAM console, click *Users* and then select the user name.

. Click *Add permissions > Attach existing policies directly*.

. Select the policy that you created.

. Click *Next* and then click *Add permissions*.

. Ensure that you have access to an access key and secret key for the IAM user.

.Result

The AWS user now has the permissions required to create the Connector from Cloud Manager. You'll need to specify AWS access keys for this user when you're prompted by Cloud Manager.

== Create a Connector

Cloud Manager enables you to create a Connector in AWS directly from its user interface.

.What you'll need

* An AWS authentication method: either the ARN of an IAM role that Cloud Manager can assume, or an AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user.

* A VPC, subnet, and keypair in your AWS region of choice.

* If you don't want Cloud Manager to automatically create an IAM role for the Connector, then you'll need to create your own link:reference-permissions-aws.html[using the policy on this page].
+
These are the permissions that the Connector needs to manage resources in your public cloud environment. It's a different set of permissions than what you provided to create the Connector instance.

.Steps

. If you're creating your first Working Environment, click *Add Working Environment* and follow the prompts. Otherwise, click the *Connector* drop-down and select *Add Connector*.
+
image:screenshot_connector_add.gif[A screenshot that shows the Connector icon in the header and the Add Connector action.]

. Choose *Amazon Web Services* as your cloud provider and click *Continue*.
+
Remember that the Connector must have a network connection to the type of working environment that you're creating and the services that you're planning to enable.
+
link:reference-networking-cloud-manager.html[Learn more about networking requirements for the Connector].

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the Connector:

* *Get Ready*: Review what you'll need.

* *AWS Credentials*: Specify your AWS region and then choose an authentication method, which is either an IAM role that Cloud Manager can assume or an AWS access key and secret key.
+
TIP: If you choose *Assume Role*, you can create the first set of credentials from the Connector deployment wizard. Any additional set of credentials must be created from the Credentials page. They will then be available from the wizard in a drop-down list. link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html[Learn how to add additional credentials].

* *Details*: Provide details about the Connector.
+
** Enter a name for the instance.
** Add custom tags (metadata) to the instance.
** Choose whether you want Cloud Manager to create a new role that has the required permissions, or if you want to select an existing role that you set up with link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the required permissions].
** Choose whether you want to encrypt the Connector's EBS disks. You have the option to use the default encryption key or to use a custom key.

* *Network*: Specify a VPC, subnet, and key pair for the instance, choose whether to enable a public IP address, and optionally specify a proxy configuration.

* *Security Group*: Choose whether to create a new security group or whether to select an existing security group that allows inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access.
+
NOTE: There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it. HTTP and HTTPS provide access to the link:concept-connectors.html#the-local-user-interface[local UI], which you'll use in rare circumstances. SSH is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting.

* *Review*: Review your selections to verify that your set up is correct.

. Click *Add*.
+
The instance should be ready in about 7 minutes. You should stay on the page until the process is complete.

.After you finish

You need to associate a Connector with workspaces so Workspace Admins can use those Connectors to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. If you only have Account Admins, then associating the Connector with workspaces isnâ€™t required. Account Admins have the ability to access all workspaces in Cloud Manager by default. link:task-setting-up-netapp-accounts.html#associating-connectors-with-workspaces[Learn more].
