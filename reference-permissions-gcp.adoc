Cloud Manager requires permissions to perform actions in your cloud provider. These permissions are included in https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[the policies provided by NetApp^]. You might want to understand what Cloud Manager does with these permissions.

The Cloud Manager policy for GCP includes the permissions that Cloud Manager needs to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
