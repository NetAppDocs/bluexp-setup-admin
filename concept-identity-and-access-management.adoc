BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) provides resource and access management that enables you to control access to your resources. With IAM, you can organize your resources according to your organization's hierarchy. For example, you can organize resources by site or department. You can then assign members permissions to access specific resources in the hierarchy and prevent access to other resources.

BlueXP IAM replaces and enhances the previous functionality provided by BlueXP accounts. link:whats-new.html#iam[Learn more about the introduction of BlueXP IAM].

BlueXP IAM is supported when using BlueXP in standard mode. If you're using BlueXP in restricted mode or private mode, then you use a BlueXP _account_ to manage users and resources.

== How BlueXP IAM works

BlueXP IAM enables you to grant access to your organization's resources by defining which members have permissions to specific resources in the organization's hierarchy. For example, a member can have project admin permissions for a project that has five associated resources. 

When using BlueXP IAM, you'll manage the following components:

* The organization
* Folders
* Projects
* Resources
* Members
* Roles and permissions
* Connectors

BlueXP resources are organized hierarchically:

* The organization is the top of the hierarchy.
* Folders are children of the organization or of another folder.
* Projects are children of the organization or of a folder.
* Resources are associated with one or more folders or projects.

The following image illustrates this hierarchy at a basic level.

image:diagram-iam-resource-hierarchy.png["A conceptual diagram that shows the resource hierarchy for BlueXP IAM: an organization, folders, projects, and resources."]

=== Organization

An _organization_ is the top level of BlueXP's IAM system and typically represents your company. Your organization consists of folders, projects, members, roles, and resources. Connectors are associated with specific projects in the organization.

When you sign up to BlueXP, you're prompted to create a new organization.

=== Folders

A _folder_ enables you to group related projects together and separate them from other projects in your organization. For example, a folder might represent a department or a geographical location. 

Folders can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both.

You don't need to create folders. They are optional.

=== Projects

A _project_ represents a workspace in BlueXP that organization members access from the BlueXP canvas in order to manage resources. For example, a project can include a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, an on-premises ONTAP cluster, or an FSx for ONTAP file system.

An organization can have one or many projects. A project can reside directly underneath the organization or within a folder.

=== Resources

A _resource_ is a working environment that BlueXP already manages or an undiscovered resource that is associated with your organization (for example, an on-premises ONTAP cluster or StorageGRID system). BlueXP is aware of undiscovered resources based on your organization's telemetry data.

When you create or discover a resource, the resource is associated with the currently selected project. That might be the only project that you want to associate this resource with. But you can choose to associate the resource with additional projects in your organization.

For example, you might associate a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system with one additional project or with all projects in your organization. How you associate a resource depends on your organization's needs.

TIP: You can also associate a Connector with another folder or project in your organization. <<Connectors,Learn more about using Connectors with BlueXP IAM>>.

[#associate-resource-folder]
==== When to associate a resource with a folder

You also have the option to associate a resource with a folder, but this is optional and meets the needs of a specific use case.

An _Organization admin_ might associate a resource with a folder so that a _Folder or project admin_ can then associate that resource with the appropriate projects that reside in the folder.

For example, let's say you have a folder that contains two projects:

image:diagram-iam-resource-association-folder-1.png["A diagram that shows a folder and two projects that reside in the folder: project A and project B."]

The _Organization admin_ can associate a resource with the folder:

image:diagram-iam-resource-association-folder-2.png["A diagram that shows a folder, a resource that is associated with the folder, and two projects that reside in the folder: project A and project B."]

Associating the resource with the folder doesn't automatically make that resource accessible from all projects in the folder. But the _Folder or project admin_ can then decide which projects that resource should be made available to. After making that decision, the admin can then associate the resource with the right projects.

In this example, the admin associates the resource with Project A:

image:diagram-iam-resource-association-folder-3.png["A diagram that shows a folder, two projects that reside in the folder: project A and project B, and a resource that is associated with project A."]

Members who have permissions for project A can now access the resource.

=== Members

Members of your organization are user accounts or service accounts. A service account is typically used by an application to complete specified tasks without human intervention.

An organization has at least one user with the _Organization admin_ role (the user who creates the organization is automatically assigned this role). You can add other members to the organization and assign different permissions across different levels of the resource hierarchy.

=== Roles and permissions

In BlueXP IAM, you don't grant permissions directly to organization members. Instead, you grant each member a role. A role contains a set of permissions that enables a member to perform specific actions at a specific level of the resource hierarchy. 

When you associate a member with a role, you need to select the entire organization, a specific folder, or a specific project. The role that you select gives a member permissions to the resources in the selected part of the resource hierarchy.

You can assign each organization member a role at different levels of the organization hierarchy. It can be the same role or a different role. For example, you can assign a member role A for project 1 and project 2. Or you can assign a member role A for project 1 and role B for project 2.

By providing permissions to a specific part of your resource hierarchy, you can restrict access rights to only the resources that a member needs to complete their tasks.

BlueXP supports several predefined roles that you can assign to the members of your organization. Custom roles are not supported at this time.

link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about IAM predefined roles].

[#associate-connectors]
=== Connectors

When you create a Connector, BlueXP automatically associates that Connector with the currently selected project in your organization. You might want to make that Connector available to use with another project in the following cases:

* You want to use that Connector to create or discover additional working environments in another project
* You associated an existing resource with another project and that resource is managed by a Connector
+
If a resource that you associated with additional project is discovered using a BlueXP Connector, then you also need to associate the Connector with the project that the resource is now associated with. Otherwise, the Connector and it's associated resource aren't accessible from the BlueXP canvas when viewing that project.

You can create an association from the *Members* page in BlueXP IAM:

* Associate a Connector with a project
+
When you associate a Connector with a project, that Connector is accessible from the BlueXP canvas when viewing the project.

* Associate a Connector with a folder
+
Associating a Connector with a folder doesn't automatically make that Connector accessible from all projects in the folder. Organization members can't access a Connector from a project until you associate the Connector with that specific project.
+
An _Organization admin_ might associate a Connector with a folder so that the _Folder or project admin_ can make the decision to associate that Connector with the appropriate projects that reside in the folder.

== IAM examples

The following examples show how you might set up your organization.

=== Simple organization

The following diagram shows a simple example of an organization that uses the default project and no folders. A single member manages the entire organization.

image:diagram-iam-example-hierarchy-simple.png["A conceptual diagram that shows an organization with a project, associated resources, and one organization admin."]

=== Advanced organization

The following diagram shows an organization that uses folders to organize the projects for each geographic location in the business. Each project has its own set of associated resources. The members include an organization admin and an admin for each folder in the organization.

image:diagram-iam-example-hierarchy-advanced.png["A conceptual diagram that shows an organization with three folders, each with three projects, and their associated resources. There are four members: one organization admin and three folder admins."]

== What you can do with BlueXP IAM

The following examples describe how you might use IAM to manage your BlueXP organization:

* Grant specific roles to specific members so that they can only complete the required tasks.
* Modify member permissions because they moved departments or because they have additional responsibilities.
* Remove a user who left the company.
* Add folders or projects to your hierarchy because a new business unit has added NetApp storage.
* Move resources from one project to another because that resource has capacity that another team can utilize.
* View the resources that a member can access.
* View the members and resources associated with a specific project.
