BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) enables you to organize and control access to your NetApp resources. You can organize your resources according to your organization's hierarchy. For example, you can organize resources by geographical location, site, or business unit. You can then assign IAM roles to members at specific parts of the hierarchy, which prevents access to resources in other parts of the hierarchy.

BlueXP IAM replaces and enhances the previous functionality provided by BlueXP accounts. link:whats-new.html#iam[Learn more about the introduction of BlueXP IAM].

BlueXP IAM is supported when using BlueXP in standard mode and restricted mode. If you're using BlueXP in private mode, then you use a BlueXP _account_ to manage users and resources.

== How BlueXP IAM works

BlueXP IAM enables you to grant access to your organization's resources by defining which members have permissions to specific parts of the organization's hierarchy. For example, a member can have project admin permissions for a project that has five associated resources. 

Users must have the Organization admin role or the Folder or project admin role to manage folders. Users with Organization admin role can create and manage resources everywhere in your BlueXP organization. Users with Folder and project admin role can only do so for the folders or projects to which they have been assigned.

link::reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP roles.]

When using BlueXP IAM, users with these roles will manage the following components:

* The organization
* Folders
* Projects
* Resources
* Members
* Roles
* Connectors

BlueXP resources are organized hierarchically:

* The organization is the top of the hierarchy.
* Folders are children of the organization or of another folder.
* Projects are children of the organization or of a folder.
* Resources are associated with one or more folders or projects.

The following image illustrates this hierarchy at a basic level.

image:diagram-iam-resource-hierarchy.png["A conceptual diagram that shows the resource hierarchy for BlueXP IAM: an organization, folders, projects, and resources."]

=== Organization

An _organization_ is the top level of BlueXP's IAM system and typically represents your company. Your organization consists of resources such as Connectors, storage, and subscriptions that you can organize into folders and projects. You can then assign organization members (user) access to folders or projects according to their responsibiities in managing your storage environments.


=== Folders

A _folder_ enables you to group related projects together and separate them from other projects in your organization. For example, a folder might represent a geographical location (EU or US East), a site (London or Toronto), or a business unit (engineering or marketing). 

Folders can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both.

Depending on the size of your organization and the number of storage resources you have, folders are a useful tool to keep your NetApp resources organized. They also allow you to better manage access if you want to share the administration of different folders with different users. You can assign a user the Folder or project admin role for a particular folder and they can then manage access to the folder and its projects, as well as create new projects in the folder. 

When you create a folder, you can assign users access to it. When you assign a user an access role to a folder, that user can perform the duties associated with that role for all projects within the respective folder. Conversely, you can choose to grant user access on a project by project basis instead.

=== Projects

A _project_ represents a workspace in BlueXP that organization members access from the BlueXP canvas in order to manage resources. For example, a project can include a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, an on-premises ONTAP cluster, or an FSx for ONTAP file system.

You create multiple projects to provide more granular access to your NetApp resources. For example, smaller organizations may have a project for each business unit or geographical location. Larger organizations may want to organize their storage resources into multiple projects per business unit to further control access. You can assign users access to resources by project or folder. 

An organization can have one or many projects. A project can reside directly underneath the organization or within a folder.

When your projects reside in a folder, you can 

=== Resources

A _resource_ is a working environment that you created or discovered in BlueXP.

When you create or discover a resource, the resource is associated with the currently selected project. That might be the only project that you want to associate this resource with. But you can choose to associate the resource with additional projects in your organization.

For example, you might associate a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system with one additional project or with all projects in your organization. How you associate a resource depends on your organization's needs.

TIP: You can also associate a Connector with another folder or project in your organization. <<Connectors,Learn more about using Connectors with BlueXP IAM>>.

[#associate-resource-folder]
==== When to associate a resource with a folder

You also have the option to associate a resource with a folder, but this is optional and meets the needs of a specific use case.

An _Organization admin_ might associate a resource with a folder so that a _Folder or project admin_ can then associate that resource with the appropriate projects that reside in the folder.

For example, let's say you have a folder that contains two projects:

image:diagram-iam-resource-association-folder-1.png["A diagram that shows a folder and two projects that reside in the folder: project A and project B."]

The _Organization admin_ can associate a resource with the folder:

image:diagram-iam-resource-association-folder-2.png["A diagram that shows a folder, a resource that is associated with the folder, and two projects that reside in the folder: project A and project B."]

Associating the resource with the folder doesn't automatically make that resource accessible from all projects in the folder. But the _Folder or project admin_ can then decide which projects that resource should be made available to. After making that decision, the admin can then associate the resource with the right projects.

In this example, the admin associates the resource with Project A:

image:diagram-iam-resource-association-folder-3.png["A diagram that shows a folder, two projects that reside in the folder: project A and project B, and a resource that is associated with project A."]

Members who have permissions for project A can now access the resource.

=== Members

Members of your organization are user accounts or service accounts. A service account is typically used by an application to complete specified tasks without human intervention.

An organization has at least one user with the _Organization admin_ role (the user who creates the organization is automatically assigned this role). You can add other members to the organization and assign different permissions across different levels of the resource hierarchy.

=== Roles and permissions

In BlueXP IAM, you don't grant permissions directly to organization members. Instead, you grant each member a role. A role contains a set of permissions that enables a member to perform specific actions at a specific level of the resource hierarchy.

By providing permissions at a specific part of the resource hierarchy, you can restrict access rights to only the resources that a member needs to complete their tasks.

==== Where you can assign roles in the hierarchy

When you associate a member with a role, you need to select the entire organization, a specific folder, or a specific project. The role that you select gives a member permissions to the resources in the selected part of the hierarchy.

[#role-inheritance]
==== Role inheritance

When you assign a role, the role is inherited down the organization hierarchy:

Organization::
Roles that you grant at the organization level are inherited by all folders, projects, and resources in the organization. That means the member has permissions to everything in the organization.

Folders::
Roles that you grant at the folder level are inherited by all folders, projects, and resources in the folder.
+
For example, if you assign a role at the folder level and that folder has three projects, the member will have permissions to those three projects and any associated resources.

Projects::
Roles that you grant at the project level are inherited by all resources associated with that project.

==== Multiple roles

You can assign each organization member a role at different levels of the organization hierarchy. It can be the same role or a different role. For example, you can assign a member role A for project 1 and project 2. Or you can assign a member role A for project 1 and role B for project 2.

==== Predefined roles

BlueXP supports several predefined roles that you can assign to the members of your organization.

link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about IAM predefined roles].

[#associate-connectors]
=== Connectors

When an _Organization admin_ creates a Connector, BlueXP automatically associates that Connector with the organization and the currently selected project. The _Organization admin_ automatically has access to that Connector from anywhere in the organization. But if you have other members in your organization with different roles, those members can only access that Connector from the project in which it was created, unless you associate that Connector with other projects.

You might want to make a Connector available to use with another project in the following cases:

* You want to allow members in your organization to use an existing Connector to create or discover additional working environments in another project

* You associated an existing resource with another project and that resource is managed by a Connector
+
If a resource that you associated with additional project is discovered using a BlueXP Connector, then you also need to associate the Connector with the project that the resource is now associated with. Otherwise, the Connector and it's associated resource aren't accessible from the BlueXP canvas by members who don't have the _Organization admin_ role.

You can create an association from the *Connectors* page in BlueXP IAM:

* Associate a Connector with a project
+
When you associate a Connector with a project, that Connector is accessible from the BlueXP canvas when viewing the project.

* Associate a Connector with a folder
+
Associating a Connector with a folder doesn't automatically make that Connector accessible from all projects in the folder. Organization members can't access a Connector from a project until you associate the Connector with that specific project.
+
An _Organization admin_ might associate a Connector with a folder so that the _Folder or project admin_ can make the decision to associate that Connector with the appropriate projects that reside in the folder.

== IAM examples

The following examples show how you might set up your organization.

=== Simple organization

The following diagram shows a simple example of an organization that uses the default project and no folders. A single member manages the entire organization.

image:diagram-iam-example-hierarchy-simple.png["A conceptual diagram that shows an organization with a project, associated resources, and one organization admin."]

=== Advanced organization

The following diagram shows an organization that uses folders to organize the projects for each geographic location in the business. Each project has its own set of associated resources. The members include an organization admin and an admin for each folder in the organization.

image:diagram-iam-example-hierarchy-advanced.png["A conceptual diagram that shows an organization with three folders, each with three projects, and their associated resources. There are four members: one organization admin and three folder admins."]

== What you can do with BlueXP IAM

The following examples describe how you might use IAM to manage your BlueXP organization:

* Grant specific roles to specific members so that they can only complete the required tasks.
* Modify member permissions because they moved departments or because they have additional responsibilities.
* Remove a user who left the company.
* Add folders or projects to your hierarchy because a new business unit has added NetApp storage.
* Associate a resource with another project because that resource has capacity that another team can utilize.
* View the resources that a member can access.
* View the members and resources associated with a specific project.
