When you sign up to BlueXP and create a new organization, the organization includes one member (an Organization admin) and one default project. To set up BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) to meet your business needs, you'll need to customize your organization's hierarchy, add additional members, add or discover resources, and associate those resources across your hierarchy.

You must have *Organization admin* permissions to administer the entire organization from BlueXP IAM. If you have *Folder or project admin* permissions, you can only administer the folders and projects for which you have permissions.

Follow these steps to set up a new BlueXP organization. The order in which you complete these steps might be different, depending on your organization's needs.

You can simply use the default project or you can create additional projects and folders that match the hierarchy of your business.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If multiple people in your business need to access and manage resources from BlueXP, you'll need to associate their user accounts with your organization and provide the appropriate permissions across your resource hierarchy. You also have the option to add service accounts to your organization.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add or discover resources in BlueXP as _working environments_. A working environment represents a storage system that organization members manage from within a project. For example, a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system or an on-premises ONTAP cluster.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When you add or discover a resource in BlueXP, that resource is automatically associated with the project that was selected when you added or discovered the working environment. If you want to make that resource available to another project in your organization, then you'll need to create an association between them.
