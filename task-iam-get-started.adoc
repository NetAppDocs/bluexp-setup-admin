When you sign up to BlueXP and create a new organization, it includes one member (an Organization admin) and one default project. To set up BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) to meet your business needs, you'll need to customize your organization's hierarchy, add additional members, add or discover resources, and associate those resources across your hierarchy. You'll complete all of these actions from BlueXP's Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.

The steps to get started with IAM include the following. The order in which you complete these steps might be different, depending on your organization's needs.

TIP: You must have *Organization admin* permissions to manage the entire organization. If you have *Folder or project admin* permissions, you can only manage the folders and projects for which you have permissions.

You can simply use the default project or you can create additional projects and folders that match the needs of your business.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If multiple people in your business need to access and manage resources from BlueXP, you'll need to add them to your organization and provide them with the appropriate permissions across your resource hierarchy.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add or discover resources as _working environments_. A working environment represents a storage system that organization members manage from within a project. For example, a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system or an on-premises ONTAP cluster.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When you add or discover a resource in BlueXP, that resource is automatically associated with the project that was selected when you added or discovered the resource. If you want to make that resource available to another folder or project in your organization, then you'll need to create an association between them.
