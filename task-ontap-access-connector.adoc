You can configure your BlueXP connector to prompt users for ONTAP credentials. This ensures that a user's ONTAP permissions are applied when they work with ONTAP clusters in both Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP on-premises clusters.

By default, the connector credentials allow any BlueXP user who has access to a resource to access the Advanced View (ONTAP system manager). You can configure BlueXP to prompt users for their ONTAP credentials instead. 

NOTE: You must have either the Organization admin or the Folder or project admin role to edit connector settings.

.Steps

. Select the *Connector* drop-down from the BlueXP header.

. Select *Manage Connectors*.

. Select the action menu in the row that corresponds to the connector you want to edit.

. Expand the *Force Credentials* option.

. Select the checkbox to enable the *Force Credentials* option and then select *Save*.

. Verify that the option is enabled by viewing the *Force Credentials* option.
