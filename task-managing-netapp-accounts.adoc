[.lead]
When you use BlueXP in private mode, you'll use a _BlueXP account_ to manage users and organize resources. When you create your account, it only includes a single user and a workspace. You can manage the account to fit your needs by adding users and creating service accounts for automation purposes. 


== Manage your account with the Tenancy API

If you want to manage your account settings by sending API requests, then you'll need to use the _Tenancy_ API. This API is different than the BlueXP API. Keep in mind that you cannot create new accounts or workspaces in private mode, even with the API.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/tenancy/overview.html[View endpoints for the Tenancy API^]

== Rename your workspace

Manage your workspaces by creating, renaming, and deleting them. Note that you can't delete a workspace if it contains any resources. It must be empty.

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down and select *Manage Account*.

. Select *Workspaces*.

. Select *Rename* to rename the workspace.



== Change your account name

Change your account name at any time to change it to something meaningful for you.

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down and select *Manage Account*.

. In the *Overview* tab, select the edit icon next to the account name.

. Type a new account name and select *Save*.

== Create and manage users

The users in your account can access and manage the resources in your workspace.

=== Add users

Associate users with your BlueXP account so those users can create and manage working environments in BlueXP.

. Select *Associate*. The user should receive an email from NetApp BlueXP titled "Account Association." The email includes the information needed to access BlueXP.

. From the Members tab, select the action menu in the row that corresponds to the user.

. Select *Disassociate User* and select *Disassociate* to confirm.



== Create and manage service accounts

A service account acts as a "user" that can make authorized API calls to BlueXP for automation purposes. This makes it easier to manage automation because you don't need to build automation scripts based on a real person's user account who can leave the company at any time.

When you create the service account, BlueXP enables you to copy or download a client ID and client secret for the service account. This key pair is used for authentication with BlueXP.

Note that a refresh token is not required for API operations when using a service account. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/platform/grant_types.html[Learn about refresh tokens^]

=== Create a service account

Create as many service accounts as you need to manage the resources in your working environments.

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down.

. From the Members tab, select *Create Service Account*.

. Enter a name.

. Select *Create*.

. Copy or download the client ID and client secret.

The client secret is visible only once and is not stored anywhere by BlueXP. Copy or download the secret and store it safely.

. Select *Close*.

=== Obtain a bearer token for a service account

In order to make API calls to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/tenancy/overview.html[Tenancy API^], you'll need to obtain a bearer token for a service account.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/platform/create_service_token.html[Learn how to create a service account token^]
