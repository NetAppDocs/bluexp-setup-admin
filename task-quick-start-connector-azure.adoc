Creating a Connector in Azure includes a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Understand your installation options

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The standard way to create a Connector in Azure is directly from BlueXP, but you can also create it from the Azure Marketplace, or you can manually install the software on a pre-existing Linux host.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need a VNet and subnet with outbound internet access to specific endpoints. If a proxy server is required for outbound internet, then you'll need the IP address, credentials, and HTTPS certificate.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on. If you plan to manually install the Connector, you should ensure that your hosts meets these requirements.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Set up Azure permissions for the installation option that you're planning to use:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *Install from BlueXP*: Create a custom role and then apply it to your Azure account or an Azure AD service principal. BlueXP authenticates with Azure and uses these permissions to create the Connector instance on your behalf.

* *Install from the Azure Marketplace*: Create a custom role that you can associate with the Connector VM instance (after installation) or with an Azure AD service principal.

* *Manual install*: Create a custom role that you can associate with the Connector VM instance or with an Azure AD service principal.
