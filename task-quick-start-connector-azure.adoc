Creating a Connector in Azure includes a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Understand your installation options

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The standard way to create a Connector in Azure is directly from BlueXP, but you can also create it from the Azure Marketplace, or you can manually install the software on a pre-existing Linux host.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need a VNet and subnet with outbound internet access to specific endpoints. If a proxy server is required for outbound internet, then you'll need the IP address, credentials, and HTTPS certificate.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on. If you plan to manually install the Connector, you should ensure that your hosts meets these requirements.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Set up Azure permissions for the installation option that you're planning to use:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *Installation from BlueXP*: Create a custom role and then apply it to your Azure account or an Azure AD service principal. BlueXP authenticates with Azure and uses these permissions to create the Connector instance on your behalf.

* *Installation from the Azure Marketplace*: Create a custom role so that you can associate it with the Connector VM instance after installation.

* *Manual install*: Create a custom role so that you can associate it with the Connector VM instance after installation.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Install the Connector using one of the available installation options:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *Installation from BlueXP*: Click the Connector drop-down, select *Add Connector* and follow the prompts.

* *Installation from the Azure Marketplace*: Go to the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manager[NetApp Connector VM page in the Azure Marketplace^] and follow the prompts to create the Connector VM.
