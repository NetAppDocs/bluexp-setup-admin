Federate with your Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to enable single sign-on (SSO) for BlueXP. This allows users to log in using their corporate credentials.

NOTE: You can federate with your corporate IdP or with the NetApp Support Site. You can't federate with both.

NetApp supports service provider-initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. You need to first configure the identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. Then, you can create a connection in BlueXP that uses the identity provider's configuration.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can only use verified domains for federation. If you want to federate with a domain that is different than your email domain, you must first verify that you own the domain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need to configure your identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. This involves creating a new application in your identity provider and providing the necessary information, such as the ACS URL and Entity ID. Service provider information varies by identity provider, so refer to the documentation for your specific identity provider for details.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To create the connection, you'll need to provide the necessary information from your identity provider, such as the SAML metadata URL or file. This information is used to establish the trust relationship between BlueXP and your identity provider. The information you provide depends on the IdP that you are using. For example, if you're using Microsoft Entra ID, you'll need to provide the SAML metadata URL or file. If you're using PingFederate, you'll need to provide the SAML metadata URL or file.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Before you can enable the connection, you can test it to ensure that everything is working correctly. The Federation page in BlueXP provides a test option that allows you to verify that the connection is working as expected. If the test is successful, you can enable the connection.
