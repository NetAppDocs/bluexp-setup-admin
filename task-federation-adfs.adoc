[.lead]
Federate with your Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to enable single sign-on (SSO) for BlueXP. This allows users to log in using their corporate credentials.

.Required role
Organization admin. link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn more about access roles.]

NOTE: You can federate with your corporate IdP or with the NetApp Support Site. You can't federate with both.

NetApp supports service provider-initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. You need to first configure the identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. Then, you can create a connection in BlueXP that uses the identity provider's configuration.

== Verify your domain
If you want to federate with a domain that is different than your email domain, you must first verify that you own the domain. You can only use verified domains for federation. 

 NOTE: If you are using your email domain, you can skip this step.

Verifying your domain consists of adding the provided DNS TXT record to your domain's DNS settings. This record is used to prove that you own the domain and allows BlueXP to use it for federation.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select the *Federation* tab.

. Select *Verify domain ownership*.

. Enter the domain that you want to verify and select *Continue*.

. Copy the provided DNS TXT record and add it to your domain's DNS settings. 

. After adding the DNS TXT record, return to the BlueXP console.

. Select *Verify domain ownership*.

. Enter the domain that you have added a DNS TXT record and select *Continue*.

. Select *Verify*. BlueXP checks for the DNS TXT record and verifies that you own the domain.


== Federate your AD FS with BlueXP
You can set up a federated connection with your AD FS to enable single sign-on (SSO) for BlueXP. The process involves configuring your AD FS to trust NetApp as a service provider and then creating the connection in BlueXP.

.Before you begin
* You must have an IdP server that is accessible from the internet.
* You must have an IdP account with administrative privileges to create the connection. You'll need to work with your IdP administrator to complete these steps.
