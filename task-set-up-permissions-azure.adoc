Set up permissions in Azure so that you can deploy the Connector with the permissions that it needs to manage your data and storage infrastructure. How you set up permissions depends on the installation option that you're planning to use.

You can choose from the following installation options:

* *Install from BlueXP*: Set up permissions that enable BlueXP to authenticate with Azure and deploy the VM. BlueXP automatically sets up permissions for the Connector VM during deployment.
+
<<Set up permissions to create the Connector from BlueXP,View step-by-step instructions>>.

* *Install from the Azure Marketplace*: Set up an Azure custom role to associate with the Connector VM or with an Azure AD service principal.
+
<<Set up permissions to assign after Azure Marketplace deployment or manual installation,View step-by-step instructions>>.

* *Manual install*: Set up an Azure custom role to associate with the Connector VM or with an Azure AD service principal.
+
<<Set up permissions to assign after Azure Marketplace deployment or manual installation,View step-by-step instructions>>.

== Set up permissions to create the Connector from BlueXP

To create a Connector from BlueXP, you need to provide BlueXP with a login that has the required permissions to create the Connector VM in Azure. You have two options:

. Sign in with your Microsoft account when prompted. This account must have specific Azure permissions. This is the default option.

. Provide details about an Azure AD service principal. This service principal also requires specific permissions.

With both options, the first step is create a custom role.

=== Create a custom role

Create a custom role that you can assign to your Azure account or to a service principal.

Note that you can create an Azure custom role using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. The following steps show how to create the role using the Azure CLI. If you would prefer to use a different method, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role[Azure documentation^]

.Steps

. Copy the required permissions for a new custom role in Azure and save them in a JSON file.
+
NOTE: This policy contains only the permissions needed to launch the Connector VM in Azure from BlueXP. Don't use this policy for other situations. When BlueXP creates the Connector, it applies a new set of permissions to the Connector VM that enables the Connector to manage the resources in your public cloud environment.

. Modify the JSON by adding your Azure subscription ID to the assignable scope.
+
*Example*
+
[source,json]
"AssignableScopes": [
"/subscriptions/d333af45-0d07-4154-943d-c25fbzzzzzzz"
],

. Use the JSON file to create a custom role in Azure.
+
The following steps describe how to create the role by using Bash in Azure Cloud Shell.

.. Start https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview[Azure Cloud Shell^] and choose the Bash environment.

.. Upload the JSON file.
+
image:screenshot_azure_shell_upload.png[A screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell where you can choose the option to upload a file.]

.. Enter the following Azure CLI command:
+
[source,azurecli]
az role definition create --role-definition Policy_for_Setup_As_Service_Azure.json

+
You should now have a custom role called _Azure SetupAsService_. You can now apply this custom role to your user account or to a service principal.

=== Set up an authentication method

To deploy the BlueXP Connector, BlueXP needs to authenticate with Azure. You can choose between two Azure authentication methods.

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Azure user account
--
Assign the custom role to the user who will deploy the Connector from BlueXP.

.Steps

. In the Azure portal, open the *Subscriptions* service and select the user's subscription.

. Click *Access control (IAM)*.

. Click *Add* > *Add role assignment* and then add the permissions:

.. Select the *Azure SetupAsService* role and click *Next*.
+
NOTE: Azure SetupAsService is the default name provided in the Connector deployment policy for Azure. If you chose a different name for the role, then select that name instead.

.. Keep *User, group, or service principal* selected.

.. Click *Select members*, choose your user account, and click *Select*.

.. Click *Next*.

.. Click *Review + assign*.

.Result

The Azure user now has the permissions required to deploy the Connector from BlueXP.
--

.Service principal
--
Rather than logging in with your Azure account, you can provide BlueXP with the credentials for an Azure service principal that has the required permissions.

Create and set up a service principal in Azure Active Directory and obtain the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs.

.Create an Azure Active Directory application for role-based access control

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=app]

.Assign the custom role to the application

. From the Azure portal, open the *Subscriptions* service.

. Select the subscription.

. Click *Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment*.

. In the *Role* tab, select the *BlueXP Operator* role and click *Next*.

. In the *Members* tab, complete the following steps:

.. Keep *User, group, or service principal* selected.
.. Click *Select members*.
+
image:screenshot-azure-service-principal-role.png[A screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Members tab when adding a role to an application.]

.. Search for the name of the application.
+
Here's an example:
+
image:screenshot_azure_service_principal_role.png[A screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Add role assignment form in the Azure portal.]

.. Select the application and click *Select*.
.. Click *Next*.

. Click *Review + assign*.
+
The service principal now has the required Azure permissions to deploy the Connector.
+
If you want to manage resources in multiple Azure subscriptions, then you must bind the service principal to each of those subscriptions. For example, BlueXP enables you to select the subscription that you want to use when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=api]

.Get the application ID and directory ID for the application

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=ids]

.Create a client secret

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=secret]

.Result

Your service principal is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you create the Connector.

== Set up permissions to assign after Azure Marketplace deployment or manual installation

If you deploy the Connector from the Azure Marketplace or if you manually install the Connector software on your own Linux host, you can provide permissions in the following ways:

* Option 1: Assign a custom role to the Azure VM using a system-assigned managed identity.
* Option 2: Provide BlueXP with the credentials for an Azure service principal that has the required permissions.

.Custom role
--
Note that you can create an Azure custom role using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. The following steps show how to create the role using the Azure CLI. If you would prefer to use a different method, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role[Azure documentation^]

.Steps 

. If you're planning to manually install the software on your own host, enable a system-assigned managed identity on the VM so that you can provide the required Azure permissions through a custom role.
