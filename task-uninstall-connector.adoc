== Uninstall the Connector when using standard or restricted mode

If you're using BlueXP in standard mode or restricted mode (in other words, the Connector host has outbound connectivity), then you should follow the steps below to uninstall the Connector software.

.Steps

. Connect to the Linux VM for the Connector.

. From the Linux host, run the uninstallation script:
+
`/opt/application/netapp/service-manager-2/uninstall.sh [silent]`
+
_silent_ runs the script without prompting you for confirmation.


== Uninstall the Connector when using private mode

If you're using BlueXP in private mode (in other words, the Connector host has _no_ outbound connectivity), then you should follow the steps below to uninstall the Connector software.

.Step

. Connect to the Linux VM for the Connector.

. From the Linux host, run the following commands:
+
[source,cli]
/opt/application/netapp/ds/cleanup.sh
rm -rf /opt/application/netapp/

. From the Linux host, remove the remove old, now unused container image files. This ensures there is enough space in the /var directory to re-install.
+
If using Podman:
[source,cli]
podman system prune --all

+
If using Docker:
[source,cli]
docker system prune -a
