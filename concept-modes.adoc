BlueXP offers multiple _deployment modes_ that enable you to meet your business and security requirements. _Standard mode_ leverages a software as a service (SaaS) layer to provide full functionality, while _restricted mode_ and _private mode_ are available for organizations that have connectivity restrictions.

While BlueXP inhibits the flow of traffic, communication, and data when using restricted mode or private mode, it's your responsibility to ensure that your environment (on-premises and in the cloud) is in compliance with the required regulations for your business.

== Overview

Each deployment mode differs in outbound connectivity, location, installation, authentication, data services, and charging methods.

Standard mode::
You use a SaaS service from the web-based console. Depending on the data services and features that you plan to use, a BlueXP admin creates one or more Connectors to manage data within your hybrid cloud environment. 
+
This mode uses encrypted data transmission over the public internet.

Restricted mode::
You install a BlueXP Connector in the cloud (in a government, sovereign, or commercial region), and it has limited outbound connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS layer.
+
This mode is typically used by state and local governments and regulated companies.
+
<<Restricted mode, Learn more about outbound connectivity to the SaaS layer>>.

Private mode::
You install a BlueXP Connector on-premises or in the cloud (in a secure region, sovereign cloud region, or commercial region) and has _no_ connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS layer. Users access the BlueXP console provided by the Connector locally, not the SaaS layer.
+
A secure region includes https://aws.amazon.com/federal/secret-cloud/[AWS Secret Cloud^], https://aws.amazon.com/federal/top-secret-cloud/[AWS Top Secret Cloud^], and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-dod-il6[Azure IL6^]

The following table provides a comparison of these modes.

BlueXP works as follows in restricted mode:

Outbound communication::
The Connector requires outbound connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS layer for data services, software upgrades, authentication, and metadata transmission.
+
The BlueXP SaaS layer does not initiate communication to the Connector. All communication is initiated by the Connector, which can pull or push data from or to the SaaS layer as required.
+
A connection is also required to cloud provider resources from within the region.

Supported location for the Connector::
In restricted mode, the Connector is supported in the cloud: in a government region, sovereign region, or commercial region.

Connector installation::
Connector installation is possible from the AWS or Azure Marketplace or a manual installation on your own Linux host.

Connector upgrades::
BlueXP provides automated upgrades of the Connector software with monthly updates.

User interface access::
The user interface is accessible from the Connector virtual machine that's deployed in your cloud region.

== Private mode

In private mode, you can install a Connector either on-premises or in the cloud and then use BlueXP to manage data across your hybrid cloud. There is no connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS layer.

The following image shows an example of a private mode deployment where the Connector is installed in the cloud and manages both Cloud Volumes ONTAP and an on-premises ONTAP cluster.

image:diagram-private-mode-cloud.png["A conceptual image that shows a virtual network in the cloud where a Connector is running and providing access to the web-based console, and is managing Cloud Volumes ONTAP and an AFF cluster in an on-premises data center."]

Meanwhile, the second image shows an example of a private mode deployment where the Connector is installed on-premises, manages an on-premises ONTAP cluster, and provides access to supported BlueXP data services.

image:diagram-private-mode-onprem.png["A conceptual image that shows an on-premises data center where a Connector is running and providing access to the web-based console, BlueXP data services, and is managing an AFF cluster in an on-premises data center."]

BlueXP works as follows in private mode:
