You can use BlueXP in environments that have full internet access, limited internet access, and no internet access. How you set up and use BlueXP depends on your requirements.

== Overview

BlueXP offers the following deployment modes, which support varying levels of connectivity:

Standard mode::
BlueXP is accessible to users as a cloud service (SaaS). This mode uses encrypted data transmission over the public internet.

Restricted mode::
The BlueXP Connector is installed in a sovereign cloud region and has outbound unidirectional connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS backend. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector.
+
This mode is typically used by state and local governments and regulated companies. 

Private mode::
The BlueXP Connector is installed on-premises or in a cloud region with complete isolation from the internet. There is no connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS backend and no connectivity outside the cloud region or data center. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector. 
+
This mode is available in restricted cloud regions (like AWS C2S/SC2S or Azure IL6) and in on-premises environments.

The following table provides a comparison of these modes.

BlueXP works as follows when using standard mode.

Outbound communication::
Connectivity is required from the Connector to the cloud provider's publicly available resources and other essential components for day-to-day operations.

Connector installation::
You can install the Connector through a setup wizard in BlueXP or from your cloud provider's marketplace. An installer is also available to manually install the Connector on your own Linux host.

Connector upgrades::
Automated software upgrades from BlueXP with monthly updates. Manual upgrades are available as well.

User interface and API access::
The BlueXP Console is accessible to users as a cloud service (SaaS).

Authentication::
Authentication is provided through BlueXP's cloud service using auth0. Identity federation is available.

Supported BlueXP services::
All BlueXP services are available to users.

Supported licensing options::
In standard mode, the licensing options available for each BlueXP service are supported. You'll need to review the documentation for each service to learn more about the available licensing options.

== Restricted mode

The following image shows how BlueXP works when deployed with restricted mode.

image:concept-restricted-mode.png[A conceptual image...]

BlueXP works as follows when deployed in restricted mode.

Outbound communication::
Outbound, unidirectional connectivity is required from the Connector to the BlueXP SaaS backend to use data services, to enable automatic software upgrades, and to use auth0-based authentication. 

Connector installation::
Online deployment through a setup wizard in BlueXP or from your cloud provider's marketplace. An installer is also available that you can run on your own Linux host.

Connector upgrades::
Automated software upgrades from BlueXP with monthly updates.

User interface and API access::
From the Connector that's deployed in your cloud region.
