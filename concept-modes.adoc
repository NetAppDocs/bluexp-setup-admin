You can use BlueXP in environments that have full internet access, limited internet access, and no internet access. How you set up and use BlueXP depends on your requirements.

== Overview

BlueXP offers the following deployment modes, which support environments with varying levels of connectivity:

Standard mode::
BlueXP is accessible to users as a cloud service (SaaS). This mode uses encrypted data transmission over the public internet.

Restricted mode::
The BlueXP Connector is installed in a sovereign cloud region and has outbound unidirectional connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS backend. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector. 
+
This mode is typically used by state and local governments and regulated companies. 

Private mode::
The BlueXP Connector is installed in a location that has complete isolation from the internet, either on-premises or in a cloud region like https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS C2S/SC2S^] or https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-dod-il6[Azure IL6^]. There is no connectivity outside the data center or cloud region. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector. 

The following table provides a comparison of these modes.

To learn more about these modes, read through the following sections.

== Standard mode

The following image shows a typical deployment when using BlueXP in standard mode.

image:diagram-standard-mode.png[A conceptual image...]

BlueXP works as follows in standard mode:

Outbound communication::
Connectivity is required from the Connector to the BlueXP SaaS backend, to your cloud provider's publicly available resources, and to other essential components for day-to-day operations.

Connector installation::
From a setup wizard in BlueXP or from your cloud provider's marketplace. An installer is also available to manually install the Connector on your own Linux host in your data center or in the cloud.

Connector upgrades::
Automated software upgrades from BlueXP with monthly updates.

User interface and API access::
From the SaaS website or locally from the Connector, if needed.

Authentication::
Authentication is provided through BlueXP's cloud service using auth0. Identity federation is available.

Supported BlueXP services::
All BlueXP services are available to users.

Supported licensing options::
In standard mode, the licensing options available for each BlueXP service are supported. You can review the documentation for each service to learn more about the available licensing options.

== Restricted mode

The following image shows a typical deployment when using BlueXP in restricted mode.

image:diagram-restricted-mode.png[A conceptual image...]

BlueXP works as follows in restricted mode:

Outbound communication::
Outbound, unidirectional connectivity is required from the Connector to the BlueXP SaaS backend to use data services, to enable automatic software upgrades, and to use auth0-based authentication. A connection is also required to cloud provider resources from within the region.

Connector installation::
From your cloud provider's marketplace or a manual installation on your own Linux host.

Connector upgrades::
Automated software upgrades from BlueXP with monthly updates.

User interface and API access::
From the Connector that's deployed in your cloud region.

Authentication::
Authentication is provided through BlueXP's cloud service using auth0. Identity federation is available.
