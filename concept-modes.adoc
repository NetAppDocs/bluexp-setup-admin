summary: BlueXP deployment modes enable you to use BlueXP in a way that meets your business requirements for data security and privacy. When using BlueXP in standard mode, the control plane is the BlueXP service and you typically deploy a Connector in your environment to connect to the control plane. With restricted mode and private mode, we include the control plane with the Connector, which limits communication between the Connector and the SaaS backend.

BlueXP _deployment modes_ enable you to use BlueXP in a way that meets your business requirements for data security and privacy. When using BlueXP in _standard mode_, the control plane is the BlueXP service and you typically deploy a Connector in your environment to connect to the control plane. With _restricted mode_ and _private mode_, we include the control plane with the Connector, which limits communication between the Connector and the SaaS backend.

While BlueXP inhibits the flow of traffic, communication, and data when using restricted mode or private mode, it's your responsibility to ensure that your environment (on premises and in the cloud) is in compliance with the required regulations.

== Overview

BlueXP offers the following deployment modes for your account. Each mode differs in terms of installation process, deployment location, authentication method, available data and storage services, and charging methods.

Standard mode::
BlueXP is accessible to users as a cloud service from the SaaS website. Depending on the BlueXP services that you're planning to use, a BlueXP admin creates one or more Connectors to manage resources and process within your hybrid cloud environment. 
+
This mode uses encrypted data transmission over the public internet.

Restricted mode::
A BlueXP Connector is installed in the cloud: in a government region, sovereign cloud region, or commercial region and has outbound connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS backend. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector, not from the SaaS website.
+
This mode is typically used by state and local governments and regulated companies.
+
<<Restricted mode, Learn more about outbound connectivity to the SaaS backend>>.

Private mode::
A BlueXP Connector is installed in a location that has complete isolation from the internet, either on-premises or in a cloud region. There is no connectivity outside the data center or cloud region. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector, not from the SaaS website.
+
The cloud region can be a commercial region or a region for secure US agencies like https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS C2S/SC2S^] or https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-dod-il6[Azure IL6^]

== Standard mode

The following image shows a typical deployment when using BlueXP in standard mode.

image:diagram-standard-mode.png["A conceptual image that shows the public internet where the user interface, API, SaaS backend, and auth0 authentication are available, a virtual network in the cloud where a Connector is running and managing Cloud Volumes ONTAP and an AFF cluster in an on-premises data center."]

BlueXP works as follows in standard mode:

Outbound communication::
Connectivity is required from the Connector to the BlueXP SaaS backend, to your cloud provider's publicly available resources, and to other essential components for day-to-day operations.
+
* link:task-set-up-networking-aws.html#endpoints-contacted-for-day-to-day-operations[Endpoints that the Connector contacts in AWS]
* link:task-set-up-networking-azure.html#endpoints-contacted-for-day-to-day-operations[Endpoints that the Connector contacts in Azure]
* link:task-set-up-networking-google.html#endpoints-contacted-for-day-to-day-operations[Endpoints that the Connector contacts in Google Cloud]

Connector installation::
From a setup wizard in BlueXP, from the AWS or Azure Marketplace, or using an installer to manually install the Connector on your own Linux host in your data center or in the cloud.

Connector upgrades::
Automated upgrades of the Connector software from BlueXP with monthly updates.

User interface and API access::
From the SaaS website or locally from the Connector, if needed.

Authentication::
Authentication is provided through BlueXP's cloud service using auth0 or through NetApp Support Site (NSS) logins. Identity federation is available.

Supported BlueXP services::
All BlueXP services are available to users.

Supported licensing options::
The supported licensing options depends on which BlueXP service you are using. Review the documentation for each service to learn more about the available licensing options.

How to use standard mode::
Standard mode is available from the BlueXP SaaS website. Go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] and sign up.

== Restricted mode

The following image shows a typical deployment when using BlueXP in restricted mode.

image:diagram-restricted-mode.png["A conceptual image that shows the public internet where the SaaS backend and auth0 authentication are available, a virtual network in the cloud where a Connector is running and providing access to the user interface and API, and is managing Cloud Volumes ONTAP and an AFF cluster in an on-premises data center."]

BlueXP works as follows in restricted mode:

Outbound communication::
Outbound connectivity is required from the Connector to the BlueXP SaaS backend to use BlueXP data services, to enable automatic software upgrades of the Connector, to use auth0-based authentication, and to send metadata for charging purposes (storage VM name, allocated capacity, and volume UUID, type, and IOPS). 
+
The BlueXP SaaS backend does not initiate communication to the Connector. All communication is initiated by the Connector, which can pull or push data from or to the SaaS backend as required.
+
A connection is also required to cloud provider resources from within the region.

Supported location for the Connector::
In the cloud, in a government region, sovereign region, or commercial region.

Connector installation::
From the AWS or Azure Marketplace, or a manual installation on your own Linux host.

Connector upgrades::
Automated upgrades of the Connector software from BlueXP with monthly updates.

User interface and API access::
From the Connector that's deployed in your cloud region.

Authentication::
Authentication is provided through BlueXP's cloud service using auth0. Identity federation is also available.

Supported BlueXP services::
BlueXP supports the following storage and data services with restricted mode:
+

== Private mode

In private mode, you can install a Connector either on premises or in the cloud and then use BlueXP to manage data across your hybrid cloud. There is no connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS backend.

The following image shows a _hybrid cloud_ deployment where the Connector is installed in the cloud and manages both Cloud Volumes ONTAP and an on-premises ONTAP cluster.

image:diagram-private-mode-cloud.png["A conceptual image that shows a virtual network in the cloud where a Connector is running and providing access to the user interface and API, and is managing Cloud Volumes ONTAP and an AFF cluster in an on-premises data center."]

Meanwhile, the second image shows an _on-premises deployment_ where the Connector manages an on-premises ONTAP cluster and provides access to supported BlueXP data services.

image:diagram-private-mode-onprem.png["A conceptual image that shows an on-premises data center where a Connector is running and providing access to the user interface, API, BlueXP data services, and is managing an AFF cluster in an on-premises data center."]

BlueXP works as follows in private mode:

Outbound communication::
No outbound connectivity is required. All packages, dependencies, and essential components are packaged with the Connector and served from the local machine. Connectivity to your cloud provider's publicly available resources is required only if you are deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

Supported location for the Connector::
In the cloud or on premises.

Connector installation::
Manual installation on your own Linux host.

Connector upgrades::
Manual upgrades of the Connector software at undefined intervals.

User interface and API access::
