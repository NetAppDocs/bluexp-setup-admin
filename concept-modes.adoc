You can use BlueXP in environments that have full internet access, limited internet access, and no internet access. How you set up and use BlueXP depends on your requirements.

== Overview

BlueXP offers the following deployment modes, which support varying levels of connectivity:

Standard mode::
BlueXP is accessible to users as a cloud service (SaaS). This mode uses encrypted data transmission over the public internet.

Restricted mode::
The BlueXP Connector is installed in a sovereign cloud region and has outbound unidirectional connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS backend. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector. This mode is typically used by state and local governments and regulated companies. 

Private mode::
The BlueXP Connector is installed in a location that has complete isolation from the internet, either on-premises or in a cloud region like https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS C2S/SC2S^] or https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-dod-il6[Azure IL6^]. 
+
There is no connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS backend and no connectivity outside the data center or cloud region. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector. 

The following table provides a comparison of these modes.
