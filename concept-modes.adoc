summary: BlueXP deployment modes enable you to use BlueXP in a way that meets your business requirements for data security and privacy. While using BlueXP in standard mode from the SaaS website should work for many customers, restricted mode and private mode limit communication between the BlueXP Connector and the BlueXP SaaS backend. Each mode offers different functionality in terms of installation process, deployment location, authentication methods, available data and storage services, and charging methods.

[.lead]
BlueXP _deployment modes_ enable you to use BlueXP in a way that meets your business requirements for data security and privacy. Using BlueXP in _standard mode_ provides full connectivity from the BlueXP Connector to the SaaS backend, while _restricted mode_ and _private mode_ limit communication between the Connector and the SaaS backend. Each mode offers different functionality in terms of installation process, deployment location, authentication method, available data and storage services, and charging methods.

While BlueXP restricts the flow of traffic, communication, and data in restricted mode and private mode, it's your responsibility to ensure that your environment (on premises and in the cloud) is in compliance with the required regulations. 

== Overview

BlueXP offers the following deployment modes for your account.

Standard mode::
BlueXP is accessible to users as a cloud service from the SaaS website. Depending on the BlueXP services that you're planning to use, a BlueXP admin creates one or more Connectors to manage resources and process within your hybrid cloud environment. 
+
This mode uses encrypted data transmission over the public internet.

Restricted mode::
A BlueXP Connector is installed in the cloud: in a government region, sovereign cloud region, or commercial region and has outbound connectivity to the BlueXP SaaS backend. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector, not from the SaaS website.
+
This mode is typically used by state and local governments and regulated companies.
+
<<Restricted mode, Learn more about outbound connectivity to the SaaS backend>>.

Private mode::
A BlueXP Connector is installed in a location that has complete isolation from the internet, either on-premises or in a cloud region. There is no connectivity outside the data center or cloud region. Users access BlueXP locally from the Connector, not from the SaaS website.
+
The cloud region can be a commercial region or a region for secure US agencies like https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS C2S/SC2S^] or https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-dod-il6[Azure IL6^]

To learn more about these modes, read through the following sections.

== Standard mode

The following image shows a typical deployment when using BlueXP in standard mode.

image:diagram-standard-mode.png[A conceptual image...]

BlueXP works as follows in standard mode:

Outbound communication::
Connectivity is required from the Connector to the BlueXP SaaS backend, to your cloud provider's publicly available resources, and to other essential components for day-to-day operations.

Connector installation::
From a setup wizard in BlueXP, from the AWS or Azure Marketplace, or using an installer to manually install the Connector on your own Linux host in your data center or in the cloud.
+
With standard mode, you can install one or more Connectors in your account, depending on your requirements.

Connector upgrades::
Automated upgrades of the Connector software from BlueXP with monthly updates.

User interface and API access::
From the SaaS website or locally from the Connector, if needed.

Authentication::
Authentication is provided through BlueXP's cloud service using auth0 or through NetApp Support Site (NSS) logins. Identity federation is available.

Supported BlueXP services::
All BlueXP services are available to users.

Supported licensing options::
The supported licensing options depends on which BlueXP service you are using. Review the documentation for each service to learn more about the available licensing options.

== Restricted mode

The following image shows a typical deployment when using BlueXP in restricted mode.

image:diagram-restricted-mode.png[A conceptual image...]

BlueXP works as follows in restricted mode:

Outbound communication::
Outbound connectivity is required from the Connector to the BlueXP SaaS backend to use BlueXP data services, to enable automatic software upgrades of the Connector, to use auth0-based authentication, and to send metadata for charging purposes (storage VM name, allocated capacity, and volume UUID, type, and IOPS). 
+
The BlueXP SaaS backend does not initiate communication to the Connector. All communication is initiated by the Connector, which can pull or push data from or to the SaaS backend as required.
+
A connection is also required to cloud provider resources from within the region.

Supported location for the Connector::
In the cloud, in a government region, sovereign region, or commercial region.

Connector installation::
From the AWS or Azure Marketplace, or a manual installation on your own Linux host.

Connector upgrades::
Automated upgrades of the Connector software from BlueXP with monthly updates.

User interface and API access::
From the Connector that's deployed in your cloud region.

Authentication::
Authentication is provided through BlueXP's cloud service using auth0. Identity federation is also available.

Supported BlueXP services::
BlueXP supports the following storage and data services with restricted mode:

== Private mode

In private mode, you can install a Connector either on premises or in the cloud and then use BlueXP to manage data across your hybrid cloud.

The following image shows a typical _hybrid cloud_ deployment when using BlueXP in private mode. In this example, the Connector is installed in the cloud.

image:diagram-private-mode-cloud.png[A conceptual image...]

Meanwhile, this second image shows a typical _on-premises deployment_ when using BlueXP in private mode.

image:diagram-private-mode-onprem.png[A conceptual image...]

BlueXP works as follows in private mode:

Outbound communication::
All packages, dependencies, and essential components are packaged with the Connector and served from the local machine. No connectivity is required to the BlueXP SaaS backend. Connectivity to your cloud provider's publicly available resources is required only if you are deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

Supported location for the Connector::
In the cloud or on premises.

Connector installation::
Manual installation on your own Linux host.

Connector upgrades::
Manual upgrades of the Connector software at undefined intervals.

User interface and API access::
From the Connector that's deployed in your cloud region or on premises.

Authentication::
Local user management and access. Authentication is not provided through BlueXP's cloud service.

Supported BlueXP services in cloud deployments::

BlueXP feature limitations::
In the Support Dashboard, adding a NetApp Support Site account and opening a case isn't supported because there is no outbound internet connection.

Supported licensing options::
Only BYOL is supported with private mode. 
+
For Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL, only node-based licensing is supported. Capacity-based licensing is not supported. Because an outbound internet connection isn't available, you will need to manually upload your Cloud Volumes ONTAP licensing file in the Digital Wallet.
