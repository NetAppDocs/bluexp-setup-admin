[.lead]
Set up your networking, prepare Azure permissions, and then install the Connector software on a Linux VM in Azure.

== Deployment overview

The following steps provide a high-level summary of the tasks that you'll complete on this page. Additional details about each of these steps are available in the sections below.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Set up networking

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need to set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment. You'll need a VNet and subnet, a network connection to the locations that BlueXP needs to manage, outbound internet access, and the details about your proxy server (if one is required).

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Review host requirements

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you want to manually install the Connector software on your own Linux host, then you should ensure that your host meets specific requirements. If youâ€™re creating the Connector from BlueXP or from the Azure Marketplace, then these requirements are taken care of for you because the software is deployed from an image.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Set up Azure permissions

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Create a custom role and then apply it to your Azure account or an Azure AD service principal. BlueXP authenticates with Azure and uses these permissions to create the Connector instance on your behalf.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Create the Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
From BlueXP, click the Connector drop-down, select *Add Connector* and follow the prompts.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Provide BlueXP with permissions

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously set up so that BlueXP can manage your data and storage infrastructure in Azure.

== Review Connector host requirements for Azure installs

The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on. If you plan to manually install the Connector, you should ensure that your host meets these requirements.

When you deploy the Connector from BlueXP or from the Azure Marketplace, the image includes the required OS and software components.

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=start]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=azure-vm]

include::_include/os-reqs.adoc[tag=end]

== Set up networking

Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment. For example, you need to ensure that connections are available to target networks and that outbound internet access is available.

Azure region::
If you use Cloud Volumes ONTAP, the Connector should be deployed in the same Azure region as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that it manages, or in the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure#azure-cross-region-replication-pairings-for-all-geographies[Azure region pair^] for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. This requirement ensures that an Azure Private Link connection is used between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-enabling-private-link.html[Learn how Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses an Azure Private Link^]

VNet and subnet::
When you create the Connector, you need to specify the VNet and subnet where the Connector should reside.

Connections to target networks::
A Connector requires a network connection to the location where you're planning to create and manage working environments. For example, the VNet where you plan to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems or the storage in your on-premises environment.

Outbound internet access::
The network location where you deploy the Connector must have an outbound internet connection to contact specific endpoints, as described in the following sections.

Endpoints contacted during manual installation::

include::_include/endpoints-manual-install.adoc[tag=endpoint-list]

include::_include/endpoints-manual-install.adoc[tag=update]

Endpoints contacted from the Connector::
The Connector requires outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints in order to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment for day-to-day operations.

== Set up Azure permissions

Set up permissions in Azure so that you can deploy the Connector with the permissions that it needs to manage your data and storage infrastructure. You have two options:

* Option 1: Assign a custom role to the Azure VM using a system-assigned managed identity.
* Option 2: Provide BlueXP with the credentials for an Azure service principal that has the required permissions.

.Custom role
--
Note that you can create an Azure custom role using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. The following steps show how to create the role using the Azure CLI. If you would prefer to use a different method, refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role[Azure documentation^]

.Steps 

. If you're planning to manually install the software on your own host, enable a system-assigned managed identity on the VM so that you can provide the required Azure permissions through a custom role.

include::_include/azure-set-up-role.adoc[]

link:task-provide-permissions-azure.html[Learn how to provide these permissions to BlueXP].
--

.Service principal
--
Create and set up a service principal in Azure Active Directory and obtain the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs.

.Create an Azure Active Directory application for role-based access control

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=app]

.Assign the application to a role
 
include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=role]

.Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=api]

.Get the application ID and directory ID for the application

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tag=ids]

.Create a client secret

include::_include/azure-set-up-service-principal.adoc[tags=secret]

.Result

Your service principal is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you add an Azure account.

== Create a Connector in Azure

Create a Connector by installing the software on your own Linux host.

.Steps

== Provide Azure permissions to BlueXP

After you install the Connector software, you need to provide BlueXP with the permissions that you previously set up. Providing the permissions enables BlueXP to manage your data and storage infrastructure in Azure.
