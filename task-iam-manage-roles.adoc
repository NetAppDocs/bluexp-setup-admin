[.lead]
BlueXP allows you to assign roles to users based on what they need to do and where. 

Users with the Organization admin or Folder or project admin roles have the responsibility of assigning roles to other users. You can assign access roles on a project or folder basis. For example, you can assign a user the Ransomware protection admin role for one project and the SnapCenter admin role for a different project. Alternatively, if a user requires the Classification admin role for all projects within a specific folder, you can grant them this access role at the folder level.

Use access roles to assign access to storage resources based on the specific BlueXP tasks that users need to perform. For example, if a BlueXP user needs to interact with ransomware protection services, they must be given an access role that includes either viewing or administrative permissions for the ransomware protection service for the project for which the access role is granted.

Assign roles to users based on your IAM strategy for enhanced security. BlueXP IAM roles are designed to ensure that users only have access to what they need.

== View roles(s) assigned to a member

When you add a member to your BlueXP organization, you are prompted to assign them a role. You can members to verify which roles they are currently assigned.

If you have the _Folder or project admin_  role, the page displays all members in the organization. However, you can only view and manage member permissions for the folders and projects for which you have permissions. link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn more about the actions that a _Folder or project admin_ can complete].

. From the *Members* page, navigate to a member in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

. In the table, expand the respective row for organization, folder, or project where you want to view the member's assigned role and select *View* in the *Role* column.


== Add an access role to an member

Typically, you'll assign a role to the member when you add them to your organization. However, You can update a member's role at anytime either by removing a role or adding a different role. You can remove a user's access to a project by removing their role.

You can assign a user an access role for your organization, folder, or project. 

Members can have multiple roles within the same project and in different projects. For example, smaller organizations may assign all available access roles to the same user, while larger organization may have users do more specialized tasks in BlueXP. Alternatively, you could also assign one user the Ransomware projection admin role for the organization. In that example, the user would be able to perform ransomware protection tasks on all projects within your organization. 

Your access role strategy should align with the way you have organized your NetApp resources in BlueXP. 

TIP: A member who is assigned the Organization admin role can't be assigned any additional roles. They already have permissions across the entire organization. A member with the Folder or project role can't be assigned any other roles within the folder or project where they have that role already. Both of these roles provide access to all BlueXP services within the scope that they are assigned.

.Steps

. From the *Members* page, navigate to a member in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Add a role*.

. To add a role, complete the steps in the dialog box:
+
* *Select an organization, folder, or project*: Choose the level of your resource hierarchy that the member should have permissions for.
+
If you select the organization or a folder, the member will have permissions to everything that resides within the organization or folder.

* *Select a category*: BlueXP separate roles into two categories: platform and data service. link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about IAM roles^].

* Select a *Role*: Choose a role that provides the member with permissions for the resources that are associated with the organization, folder, or project that you selected.

link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about predefined IAM roles].
* *Add role*: If you want to provide access to additional folders or projects within your organization, select *Add role*, specify another folder or project or role category, and then select a role category and a corresponding role.

. Select *Add new roles*.


=== Change a member's assigned role

You can change the assigned roles for a member should you need to adjust the access for a user.

.Steps

. From the *Members* page, navigate to a member in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

. In the table, expand the respective row for organization, folder, or project where you want to change the member's assigned role and select *View* in the *Role* column to view the roles assigned to this member.

. You can change an existing role for a member or remove a role.

.. To change a member's role, elect *Change* next to the role you want to change. You can only change this role to a role within the same role category. For example, you can change from one data service role to another. You'll be asked to confirm the change.

.. To unassign a member's role, select image:icon-delete.png["An icon that resembles a trash can"] next to the role to unassign the member the respective role. You'll be asked to confirm the removal.

== Ensure the resource is associated with a project

You must associate your resources to IAM projects in order to control access. Resources include storage resources such as Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Keystone subscriptions, ONTAP on-premises resources and so on. 

Users with the Organization admin or Folder or project admin roles can assign resources to projects.

You need to associate your resources to projects in order to grant user access. You can associate multiple resources with the same project, and then assign users to the project based on the role you assign to them.

If a resource requires Connector for discovery (such as Cloud Volumes ONTAP), you also need to associate the Connector with the same project.


link:task-iam-associate-connectors.html[Learn how to associate a Connector with a folder or project].


.Steps

. From the *Resources* page, navigate to a resource in the table, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *Associate to folders or projects*.

. Select a project and then select *Accept*.

. To associate the resource with another project, select *Add folder or project* and then select  project.
