You can see details about your Google Cloud Storage buckets, including the location, access status, storage class, total and used capacity, and more. These buckets can be used as destinations for BlueXP backup and recovery, BlueXP tiering, or BlueXP copy and sync operations.

A newly added feature now enables you to create and edit Google Cloud Storage buckets. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-google-cloud-storage/index.html[Go here to see how you can view, create, and manage your Cloud Storage buckets using BlueXP^].
