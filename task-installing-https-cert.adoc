By default, BlueXP uses a self-signed SSL certificate to provide secure access to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/[BlueXP web-based console^] using an HTTPS connection. If required by your business, you can install a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA), which provides better security protection than a self-signed certificate. After you install the certificate, BlueXP uses the CA-signed certificate when users access the web-based console.
