[.lead]
How you set up Azure permissions depends on how you intend to install the Connector. Expand the section that matches your chosen installation option.

== Prepare permissions for deployment from BlueXP

To create a Connector from BlueXP, you need to provide BlueXP with a login that has the required permissions to create the Connector VM in Azure. You have two options:

. Sign in with your Microsoft account when prompted. This account must have specific Azure permissions. This is the default option.
+
<<Set up permissions for an Azure account,Follow the steps below to get started>>.

. Provide details about an Azure AD service principal. This service principal also requires specific permissions.
+
<<Set up permissions using a service principal,Follow the steps below to get started>>.

=== Set up permissions for an Azure account

Before you can deploy a Connector from BlueXP, you need to ensure that your Azure account has the correct permissions.

.Steps

. Copy the required permissions for a new custom role in Azure and save them in a JSON file.
+
NOTE: This policy contains only the permissions needed to launch the Connector VM in Azure from BlueXP. Don't use this policy for other situations. When BlueXP creates the Connector, it applies a new set of permissions to the Connector VM that enables the Connector to manage the resources in your public cloud environment.

. Use the JSON file to create a custom role in Azure.
+
The following steps describe how to create the role by using Bash in Azure Cloud Shell.

.. Start https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview[Azure Cloud Shell^] and choose the Bash environment.

.. Upload the JSON file.
+
image:screenshot_azure_shell_upload.png[A screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell where you can choose the option to upload a file.]

.. Enter the following Azure CLI command:
+
[source,azurecli]
az role definition create --role-definition Policy_for_Setup_As_Service_Azure.json

+
You should now have a custom role called _Azure SetupAsService_.

. Assign the role to the user who will deploy the Connector from BlueXP:

.. Open the *Subscriptions* service and select the user's subscription.

.. Click *Access control (IAM)*.

.. Click *Add* > *Add role assignment* and then add the permissions:

* Select the *Azure SetupAsService* role and click *Next*.
+
NOTE: Azure SetupAsService is the default name provided in the Connector deployment policy for Azure. If you chose a different name for the role, then select that name instead.

* Keep *User, group, or service principal* selected.

* Click *Select members*, choose your user account, and click *Select*.

* Click *Next*.

* Click *Review + assign*.

.Result

The Azure user now has the permissions required to deploy the Connector from BlueXP.

=== Set up permissions using a service principal

Rather than logging in with you Azure account, you also have the option to provide BlueXP with the credentials for an Azure service principal that has the required permissions.

Create and set up a service principal in Azure Active Directory and obtain the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs.

.Steps

. <<Create an Azure Active Directory application>>.

. <<Assign the application to a role>>.

. <<Add Windows Azure Service Management API permissions>>.

. <<Get the application ID and directory ID>>.

. <<Create a client secret>>.

==== Create an Azure Active Directory application

Create an Azure Active Directory (AD) application and service principal that BlueXP can use to deploy the Connector.

.Before you begin

You must have the right permissions in Azure to create an Active Directory application and to assign the application to a role. For details, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#required-permissions/[Microsoft Azure Documentation: Required permissions^].

.Steps
. From the Azure portal, open the *Azure Active Directory* service.
+
image:screenshot_azure_ad.gif[Shows the Active Directory service in Microsoft Azure.]

. In the menu, click *App registrations*.

. Click *New registration*.

. Specify details about the application:

* *Name*: Enter a name for the application.
* *Account type*: Select an account type (any will work with BlueXP).
* *Redirect URI*: You can leave this field blank.

. Click *Register*.

.Result

You've created the AD application and service principal.

==== Assign the application to a role

You must bind the service principal to the Azure subscription in which you plan to deploy the Connector and assign it the custom "Azure SetupAsService" role.

.Steps

. Copy the required permissions for a new custom role in Azure and save them in a JSON file.
+
NOTE: This policy contains only the permissions needed to launch the Connector VM in Azure from BlueXP. Don't use this policy for other situations. When BlueXP creates the Connector, it applies a new set of permissions to the Connector VM that enables the Connector to manage the resources in your public cloud environment.

[[ids]]
==== Get the application ID and directory ID

When you create the Connector from BlueXP, you need to provide the application (client) ID and the directory (tenant) ID for the application. BlueXP uses the IDs to programmatically sign in.

.Steps

. In the *Azure Active Directory* service, click *App registrations* and select the application.

. Copy the *Application (client) ID* and the *Directory (tenant) ID*.
+
image:screenshot_azure_app_ids.gif[A screenshot that shows the application (client) ID and directory (tenant) ID for an application in Azure Active Directory.]

==== Create a client secret

You need to create a client secret and then provide BlueXP with the value of the secret so BlueXP can use it to authenticate with Azure AD.

.Steps

. Open the *Azure Active Directory* service.

. Click *App registrations* and select your application.

. Click *Certificates & secrets > New client secret*.

. Provide a description of the secret and a duration.

. Click *Add*.

. Copy the value of the client secret.
+
image:screenshot_azure_client_secret.gif[A screenshot of the Azure portal that shows a client secret for the Azure AD service principal.]

.Result

Your service principal is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you create the Connector.

== Prepare permissions for deployment from the Azure Marketplace

Create a custom role with the required permissions.

.Steps

. Copy the contents of the link:reference-permissions-azure.html[custom role permissions for the Connector] and save them in a JSON file.

. Modify the JSON file by adding Azure subscription IDs to the assignable scope.
+
You should add the ID for each Azure subscription from which users will create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.
+
*Example*
+
[source,json]
"AssignableScopes": [
"/subscriptions/d333af45-0d07-4154-943d-c25fbzzzzzzz",
