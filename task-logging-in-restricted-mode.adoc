When you use BlueXP in restricted mode, you'll need to log in to the BlueXP console from the user interface that runs locally on the Connector.

.Log in options

Restricted mode supports logging in with one of the following options:

* A NetApp cloud login using your email address and a password
* A federated connection
+
A federated connection enables single sign-on using credentials from your corporate directory (federated identity). To learn more, go to the https://cloud.netapp.com/help-center[BlueXP Help Center^] and then click *sign-in options*.

.Steps

. Open a web browser and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_
+
_ipaddress_ can be localhost, a private IP address, or a public IP address, depending on the configuration of the host where you installed the Connector. For example, if the Connector is in the public cloud without a public IP address, you must enter a private IP address from a host that has a connection to the Connector host.

. Enter your user name and password to log in.

.Result

You're now logged in and can start using BlueXP to manage your hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure.
