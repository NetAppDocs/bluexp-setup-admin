[.lead]
 When an _Organization admin_ creates a Connector, it is automatcially associated with currently selected project within the organization. Although someone with the _Organization admin_  can access to that Connector from anywhere in the organization. Other members in your organization can only access that Connector from the project in which it was created, unless you associate that Connector with other projects.

.Before you begin

You should understand how Connector association works. link:concept-identity-and-access-management.html#associate-connectors[Learn about using Connectors with BlueXP IAM].

.About this task

* When a _Folder or project admin_ views the *Connectors* page, the page displays all Connectors in the organization. However, a member with this role can only view and associate Connectors with the folders and projects for which they have permissions. link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn more about the actions that a _Folder or project admin_ can complete].

.Steps

. In the upper right of the console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select *Connectors*.

. From the table, find the Connector that you want to associate.
+
To find a specific Connector, you can use the search that's above the table and filter the contents of the table by selecting a specific part of the resource hierarchy.

. To view the folders and projects that the Connector is associated with, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.

. Select *Associate to folder or project*.

. Select a folder or project and then select *Accept*.

. To associate the Connector with an additional folder or project, select *Add a folder or project* and then select the folder or project.

. Select *Associate Connector*.


.After you finish

If you want to associate the resources that the Connector manages with the same folders and projects, you can do so from the Resources page.
