A Connector is required to manage several types of working environments from BlueXP. When you create a Connector, BlueXP automatically associates that Connector with the currently selected project in your organization. If you want to make that Connector available to use with another folder or project in your organization, then you need to create an association from BlueXP identity and access management (IAM).

.Before you begin

You should understand how Connector association works. link:concept-identity-and-access-management.html#associate-connectors[Learn about using Connectors with BlueXP IAM].

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.

. Select *Connectors*.

. From the table, find the Connector that you want to associate.
+
To find a specific Connector, you can use the search that's above the table and filter the contents of the table by selecting a specific part of the resource hierarchy.

. To first view the folders and projects that the Connector is associated with, select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] and then select *View details*.
+
BlueXP displays details about the folders and projects that the Connector is associated with.

. Select *Associate to folder or project*.

. Select a folder or project and then select *Accept*.

. To associate the Connector with an additional folder or project, select *Add a folder or project* and then select the folder or project.

. Select *Associate Connector*.

.Result

BlueXP associates the Connector with the selected folders and projects. Members who have permissions for those folders and projects now have the ability to select that Connector.

.After you finish

If you want to associate the resources that the Connector manages with the same folders and projects, you can do so from the Resources page.
