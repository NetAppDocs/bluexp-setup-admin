You should understand what's needed to get started with BlueXP in restricted mode so that you can prepare your environment.

== Understand your installation options

You can choose from the following options to create a Connector in AWS:

* Create the Connector directly from BlueXP (this is the )
* Create a Connector from the AWS Marketplace
* Download the installer and manually install the software on your own Linux host

The option that you choose impacts how you provide BlueXP with the required AWS permissions that it needs to authenticate and manage resources in AWS. 

== Review host requirements for manual installations

The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on. You should review this information when choosing a manual installation.

When you deploy the Connector from BlueXP or from the AWS Marketplace, the image includes the required OS and software components. 

Dedicated host::
The Connector is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications. The host must be a dedicated host.

Supported locations::
In restricted mode, you can only install the Connector in the cloud.

Supported operating systems::
* CentOS 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, and 8.6
+
The host must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it's not registered, the host can't access repositories to update required 3rd-party software during Connector installation.
+
The Connector is supported on English-language versions of these operating systems.

Hypervisor::
A bare metal or hosted hypervisor that is certified to run CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux is required. https://access.redhat.com/certified-hypervisors[Red Hat Solution: Which hypervisors are certified to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux?^]

Networking::
<<Prepare networking for the Connector,Refer to the section below>>.

CPU:: 4 cores or 4 vCPUs

RAM:: 14 GB

AWS EC2 instance type::
An instance type that meets the CPU and RAM requirements above. We recommend t3.xlarge.

Azure VM size::
An instance type that meets the CPU and RAM requirements above. We recommend DS3 v2.

GCP machine type::
An instance type that meets the CPU and RAM requirements above. We recommend n2-standard-4.
+
The Connector is supported in Google Cloud on a VM instance with an OS that supports https://cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/shielded-vm[Shielded VM features^]

Disk space in /opt:: 100 GiB of space must be available

Disk space in /var:: 20 GiB of space must be available

Docker Engine:: Docker Engine version 19.3.1 or later is required on the host before you install the Connector. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[View installation instructions^]

== Prepare networking for the Connector

Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. Other than having a virtual network and subnet for the Connector, you'll need to ensure that the following requirements are met.

=== Connection to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the type of working environment that you're creating and the services that you're planning to enable.

For example, if you install a Connector in your corporate network, then you must set up a VPN connection to the virtual network in which you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

=== Proxy server

If your organization requires deployment of an HTTP proxy for all outgoing internet traffic, obtain the following information about your HTTP proxy:

* IP address
* Credentials
* HTTPS certificate

=== Security group

There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it or if the Connector is used as a proxy for AutoSupport messages. HTTP and HTTPS provide access to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html#the-local-user-interface[local UI], which you'll use in rare circumstances. SSH is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting.

=== IP address limitation

There's a possible conflict with IP addresses in the 172 range. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-limitations.html[Learn more about this limitation].

=== Outbound internet access for manual installs

If you plan to manually install the Connector on your own Linux host, the installer for the Connector requires access to the following URLs during the installation process:

* \https://support.netapp.com
* \https://mysupport.netapp.com
* \https://cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com/tenancy
* \https://stream.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com
* \https://cloudmanagerinfraprod.azurecr.io
* \https://production-artifacts.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com
* \https://*.blob.core.windows.net

The host might try to update operating system packages during installation. The host can contact different mirroring sites for these OS packages.

=== Outbound internet access for day-to-day operations

The network location where you deploy the Connector must have an outbound internet connection. The Connector requires outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints in order to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

[cols=2*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Endpoints
| Purpose

| 
\https://<region>.amazonaws.com

\https://*.blob.core.windows.net
| To upgrade the Connector and its Docker components.

|===

== Prepare cloud permissions

BlueXP requires permissions from your cloud provider to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a virtual network and to use Cloud Backup and Cloud Data Sense. You need to set up permissions in your cloud provider and then associate those permission with the Connector instance after you install it.

The option that you choose impacts how you provide BlueXP with the required AWS permissions that it needs to authenticate and manage resources in AWS. 

// Start snippet: collapsible block (open on page load)
.Prepare permissions for deployment from BlueXP
[%collapsible]
====
BlueXP needs to authenticate with AWS before it can deploy the Connector instance in your VPC. You can choose one of these authentication methods:

* Let BlueXP assume an IAM role that has the required permissions
* Provide an AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user who has the required permissions

With either option, you first need to start by creating an IAM policy that includes the required permissions.

== Create an IAM policy

This policy contains only the permissions needed to launch the Connector instance in AWS from BlueXP. Don't use this policy for other situations.

When BlueXP creates the Connector, it applies a new set of permissions to the Connector instance that enables the Connector to manage the resources in your public cloud environment.

.Steps

. Go to the AWS IAM console.

. Click *Policies > Create policy*.

. Click *JSON*.

. Copy and paste the following policy:
+
[source,json]

            },
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

. Click *Next* and add tags, if needed.

. Click *Next* and enter a name and description.

. Click *Create policy*.

.What's next?

Either attach the policy to an IAM role that BlueXP can assume or to an IAM user.

== Set up an IAM role

Set up an IAM role that BlueXP can assume in order to deploy the Connector in AWS.

.Steps

. Go to the AWS IAM console in the target account.

. Under Access Management, click *Roles > Create Role* and follow the steps to create the role.
+
Be sure to do the following:

* Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.
* Select *Another AWS account* and enter the ID of the BlueXP SaaS account: 952013314444
* Select the policy that you created in the previous section.

. After you create the role, copy the Role ARN so that you can paste it in BlueXP when you create the Connector.

.Result

The IAM role now has the required permissions.

== Set up permissions for an IAM user

When you create a Connector, you can provide an AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user who has the required permissions to deploy the Connector instance.

.Steps

. From the AWS IAM console, click *Users* and then select the user name.

. Click *Add permissions > Attach existing policies directly*.

. Select the policy that you created.

. Click *Next* and then click *Add permissions*.

. Ensure that you have access to an access key and secret key for the IAM user.

.Result

The AWS user now has the permissions required to create the Connector from BlueXP. You'll need to specify AWS access keys for this user when you're prompted by BlueXP.

+
image:screenshot_connector_add.gif[A screenshot that shows the Connector icon in the header and the Add Connector action.]

. Choose *Amazon Web Services* as your cloud provider and click *Continue*.

. On the *Deploying a Connector* page, review the details about what you'll need. You have two options:

.. Click *Continue* to prepare for deployment by using the in-product guide. Each step in the in-product guide includes the information that's contained on this page of the documentation.

.. Click *Skip to Deployment* if you already prepared by following the steps on this page.

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the Connector:

* *Get Ready*: Review what you'll need.

* *AWS Credentials*: Specify your AWS region and then choose an authentication method, which is either an IAM role that BlueXP can assume or an AWS access key and secret key.
+
TIP: If you choose *Assume Role*, you can create the first set of credentials from the Connector deployment wizard. Any additional set of credentials must be created from the Credentials page. They will then be available from the wizard in a drop-down list. link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html[Learn how to add additional credentials].

* *Details*: Provide details about the Connector.
+
** Enter a name for the instance.
** Add custom tags (metadata) to the instance.
** Choose whether you want BlueXP to create a new role that has the required permissions, or if you want to select an existing role that you set up with link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the required permissions].
** Choose whether you want to encrypt the Connector's EBS disks. You have the option to use the default encryption key or to use a custom key.

* *Network*: Specify a VPC, subnet, and key pair for the instance, choose whether to enable a public IP address, and optionally specify a proxy configuration.
+
Make sure that you have the correct key pair to use with the Connector. Without a key pair, you will not be able to access the Connector virtual machine.

* *Security Group*: Choose whether to create a new security group or whether to select an existing security group that allows inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access.

* *Review*: Review your selections to verify that your set up is correct.

. Click *Add*.
+
The instance should be ready in about 7 minutes. You should stay on the page until the process is complete.

. Change any of the default options and click *Continue to Launch*.

. Under *Choose Action*, select *Launch through EC2* and then click *Launch*.
+
These steps describe how to launch the instance from the EC2 Console because the console enables you to attach an IAM role to the Connector instance. This isn't possible using the *Launch from Website* action.

. Follow the prompts to configure and deploy the instance:

* *Name and tags*: Enter a name and tags for the instance.

* *Application and OS Image*: Skip this section. The Connector AMI is already selected.

* *Instance type*: Depending on region availability, choose one of the supported instance types (t3.xlarge is recommended).
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html[Review the instance requirements].

* *Key pair (login)*: Select the key pair that you want to use to securely connect to the instance.

* *Network settings*: Edit the network settings as needed:
+
** Choose the desired VPC and subnet.
** Specify whether the instance should have a public IP address.
** Specify firewall settings that enable the required connection methods for the Connector instance: SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.

* *Configure storage*: Keep the default storage options.

* *Advanced details*: Under *IAM instance profile*, choose the IAM role that includes the required permissions for the Connector.
+
link:task-prepare-restricted-mode.html[Learn how to set up AWS permissions].

* *Summary*: Review the summary and click *Launch instance*.

.Result

AWS launches the software with the specified settings. The Connector instance and software should be running in approximately five minutes.

.What's next?

Set up BlueXP.
--

.Manual install
--
.What you'll need

* Root privileges to install the Connector.

* Details about a proxy server, if a proxy is required for internet access from the Connector.
+
You have the option to configure a proxy server after installation but doing so requires restarting the Connector.

* A CA-signed certificate, if the proxy server uses HTTPS.

.About this task

* The installation installs the AWS command line tools (awscli) to enable recovery procedures from NetApp support.
+
If you receive a message that installing the awscli failed, you can safely ignore the message. The Connector can operate successfully without the tools.

* The installer that is available on the NetApp Support Site might be an earlier version. After installation, the Connector automatically updates itself if a new version is available.

.Steps

. Verify that docker is enabled and running.
+
[source,cli]
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker

. Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], and then copy it to the Linux host.
+
You should download the "online" Connector installer that's meant for use in your network or in the cloud. A separate "offline" installer is available for the Connector, but it's only supported with private mode deployments.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.23

. Run the installation script.
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.23 --proxy <HTTP or HTTPS proxy server> --cacert <path and file name of a CA-signed certificate>
+
The --proxy and --cacert parameters are optional. If you have a proxy server, you will need to enter the parameter(s) as shown. The installer doesn't prompt you to provide information about a proxy.
+
Here's an example of the command using both optional parameters:
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.23 --proxy https://user:password@10.0.0.30:8080/ --cacert /tmp/cacert/certificate.cer
+
--proxy configures the Connector to use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy server using one of the following formats:
+
* \http://address:port
* \http://username:password@address:port
* \https://address:port
* \https://username:password@address:port

+
--cacert specifies a CA-signed certificate to use for HTTPS access between the Connector and the proxy server. This parameter is required only if you specify an HTTPS proxy server.

.Result

The Connector is now installed. At the end of the installation, the Connector service (occm) restarts twice if you specified a proxy server.

.What's next?

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#attach-iam-role[Attach the IAM role that you previously created to the Connector EC2 instance].

Now that you've deployed the Connector, you need to provide the permissions that you previously set up so that you can use BlueXP services.
