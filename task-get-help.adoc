== Manage your support cases

You can view and manage active and resolved support cases directly from BlueXP. You can manage the cases associated with your NSS account and with your company.

Case management is available as a Preview. We plan to refine this experience and add enhancements in upcoming releases. Please send us feedback by using the in-product chat.

.Steps

. In BlueXP, click *Help > Support*.

. Click *Case Management* and if you're prompted, add your NSS account to BlueXP.

The *Case management* page shows open cases related to the NSS account that is associated with your BlueXP user account. This is the same NSS account that appears at the top of the *NSS management* page.
