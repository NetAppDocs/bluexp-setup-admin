[role="quick-margin-para"]
You don't need a Connector to get started with BlueXP, but you can create a Connector to unlock all BlueXP features and services. The Connector is NetApp software that enables BlueXP to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.

A BlueXP Account Admin can create a Connector in your cloud or on-premises network.
