Get started with BlueXP in standard mode in a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Sign up and create an account

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] and sign up. You'll be given the option to create an account, but you can skip that step if you're being invited to an existing account.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
At this point, you're logged in and can start using several BlueXP services like Digital Advisor, Amazon FSx for ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, and more.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You don't need a Connector to get started with BlueXP, but you can create a Connector to unlock all BlueXP features and services. The Connector is NetApp software that enables BlueXP to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.

A BlueXP Account Admin can create a Connector in your cloud or on-premises network.
