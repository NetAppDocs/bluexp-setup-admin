Get started with BlueXP in standard mode by preparing networking for the BlueXP console, signing up and creating an account, optionally creating a Connector, and subscribing to NetApp Intelligent Services.

In standard mode, you access a web-based console that is hosted as a Software-as-a-service (SaaS) product from NetApp. Before you get started, you should have an understanding of link:concept-modes.html[deployment modes] and link:concept-connectors.html[Connectors].

Computers that access the BlueXP console should have connections to specific endpoints to complete a few administrative tasks. If your network restricts outbound access, you should ensure that these endpoints are allowed.

Go to the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[BlueXP console^] and sign up. You'll be given the option to create a BlueXP organization, but you can skip that step if you're being invited to an existing organization.

At this point, you're logged in and can start using several BlueXP services like Digital Advisor, Amazon FSx for ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, and more. link:concept-connectors.html[Learn what you can do without a Connector].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You don't need a Connector to get started with BlueXP, but you can create a Connector to unlock all BlueXP features and services. The Connector is NetApp software that enables BlueXP to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can create a Connector in your cloud or on-premises network.

Note that if you want to use BlueXP services to manage storage and data in Google Cloud, then the Connector must be running in Google Cloud.
