Creating a Connector in AWS includes a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Understand your installation options

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The standard way to create a Connector in AWS is directly from BlueXP, but you can also create it from the AWS Marketplace, or manually install the software yourself.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need a VPC and subnet with outbound internet access to specific endpoints. If a proxy server is required for outbound internet, then you'll need the IP address, credentials, and HTTPS certificate.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on. If you plan to manually install the Connector, you should ensure that your hosts meets these requirements.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Set up AWS permissions for the installation option that you're planning to use:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *From BlueXP*: Create an IAM policy and attach it to an IAM role that BlueXP can assume or to an IAM user that you can provide access keys for. BlueXP authenticates with AWS and uses these permissions to create the Connector instance on your behalf.

* *From the AWS Marketplace*: Create an IAM policy and attach it to an IAM role. You'll associate this role with the Connector EC2 instance.

* *Manual install*: Create an IAM policy and attach it to an IAM role. You'll associate this role with the Connector EC2 instance.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Install the Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Install the Connector using one of the available installation options:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *From BlueXP*: Click the Connector drop-down, select *Add Connector* and follow the prompts.

* *From the AWS Marketplace*: Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B018REK8QG[BlueXP page on the AWS Marketplace^] and follow the prompts to launch through EC2 so that you can attach an IAM role.

* *Manual install*: Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site] and run the installation script.
