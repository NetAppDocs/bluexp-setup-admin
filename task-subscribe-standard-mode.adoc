summary: Subscribe to BlueXP from your cloud provider's marketplace to pay for BlueXP services at an hourly rate or through an annual contract. If you purchased a license from NetApp, you also need to subscribe to the marketplace offering. Your license is always charged first, but you'll be charged at the hourly rate if you exceed your licensed capacity or if the license's term expires.

.Before you begin

Subscribing to BlueXP involves associating a marketplace subscription with the cloud credentials that are associated with a Connector. If you followed the "Get started with standard mode" workflow, then you should already have a Connector.
