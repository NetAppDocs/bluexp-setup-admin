== Step 1: Set up networking

Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment. For example, you need to ensure that connections are available to target networks and that outbound internet access is available.

VPC and subnet:: 

When you create the Connector, you need to specify the VPC and subnet where the Connector should reside.

Connections to target networks::

A Connector requires a network connection to the location where you're planning to create and manage working environments.

Outbound internet access::

The network location where you deploy the Connector must have an outbound internet connection. Outbound internet access is also required from your web browser when deploying the Connector from the BlueXP console.

Endpoints contacted from the BlueXP console::

As you use the BlueXP web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer, it contacts several endpoints to complete data management tasks. This includes endpoints that are contacted to deploy the Connector from the BlueXP console.

include::_include/endpoints-manual-install.adoc[tag=update]

Endpoints contacted from the Connector::

The Connector requires outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints in order to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment for day-to-day operations.

== Step 2: Set up Google Cloud permissions

Set up permissions in Google Cloud so that you can deploy the Connector with the permissions that it needs to manage your data and storage infrastructure.

You need to set up Google Cloud permissions as follows:

* If you are planning to create the Connector from BlueXP or by using gcloud, then you need to set up permissions for the Google Cloud user who will deploy the Connector VM.

* Set up permissions for the Connector by creating a role and granting the role to a service account.
+
You'll associate this service account with the Connector VM so that BlueXP has the required permissions. 

Depending on your configuration, you might need to complete the following steps as well:

* Set up permissions across projects
* Set up permissions for a shared VPC

=== Set up permissions to create the Connector from BlueXP or gcloud

Before you can deploy a Connector from BlueXP or by using gcloud, you need to ensure that your Google Cloud account has the correct permissions.

.Steps

. Create a custom role in Google Cloud:

.. Create a YAML file that includes the following permissions:
+
[source,yaml]
title: Connector deployment policy
description: Permissions for the user who deploys the Connector from BlueXP
stage: GA
includedPermissions:
- compute.disks.create
- compute.disks.get
- compute.disks.list
- compute.disks.setLabels
- compute.disks.use
- compute.firewalls.create
- compute.firewalls.delete
- compute.firewalls.get
- compute.firewalls.list
- compute.globalOperations.get
- compute.images.get
- compute.images.getFromFamily
- compute.images.list
- compute.images.useReadOnly
- compute.instances.attachDisk
- compute.instances.create
- compute.instances.get
- compute.instances.list
- compute.instances.setDeletionProtection
- compute.instances.setLabels
- compute.instances.setMachineType
- compute.instances.setMetadata
- compute.instances.setTags
- compute.instances.start
- compute.instances.updateDisplayDevice
- compute.machineTypes.get
- compute.networks.get
- compute.networks.list
- compute.networks.updatePolicy
- compute.projects.get
- compute.regions.get
- compute.regions.list
- compute.subnetworks.get
- compute.subnetworks.list
- compute.zoneOperations.get
- compute.zones.get
- compute.zones.list
- deploymentmanager.compositeTypes.get
- deploymentmanager.compositeTypes.list
- deploymentmanager.deployments.create
- deploymentmanager.deployments.delete
- deploymentmanager.deployments.get
- deploymentmanager.deployments.list
- deploymentmanager.manifests.get
- deploymentmanager.manifests.list
- deploymentmanager.operations.get
- deploymentmanager.operations.list
- deploymentmanager.resources.get
- deploymentmanager.resources.list
- deploymentmanager.typeProviders.get
- deploymentmanager.typeProviders.list
- deploymentmanager.types.get
- deploymentmanager.types.list
- resourcemanager.projects.get
- compute.instances.setServiceAccount
- iam.serviceAccounts.list

.. From Google Cloud, activate cloud shell.

.. Upload the YAML file that includes the required permissions.

.. Create a custom role by using the `gcloud iam roles create` command.
+
The following example creates a role named "connectorDeployment" at the project level:
+
gcloud iam roles create connectorDeployment --project=myproject --file=connector-deployment.yaml
+
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#iam-custom-roles-create-gcloud[Google Cloud docs: Creating and managing custom roles^]

. Assign this custom role to the user who will deploy the Connector from BlueXP or by using gcloud.
+
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role[Google Cloud docs: Grant a single role^]

.Result

The Google Cloud user now has the permissions required to create the Connector.

=== Set up permissions for the Connector

A service account is required to provide the Connector with the permissions that BlueXP needs to manage resources in Google Cloud. You need to associate this service account with the Connector VM.

.Steps

. Create a custom role in Google Cloud:

.. Create a YAML file that includes the contents of the link:reference-permissions-gcp.html[service account permissions for the Connector].

.. From Google Cloud, activate cloud shell.

.. Upload the YAML file that includes the required permissions.

.. Create a custom role by using the `gcloud iam roles create` command.
+
The following example creates a role named "connector" at the project level:
+
`gcloud iam roles create connector --project=myproject --file=connector.yaml`
+
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#iam-custom-roles-create-gcloud[Google Cloud docs: Creating and managing custom roles^]

. Create a service account in Google Cloud:

.. From the IAM & Admin service, select *Service Accounts > Create Service Account*.

.. Enter service account details and select *Create and Continue*.

.. Select the role that you just created.

.. Finish the remaining steps to create the role.
+
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Google Cloud docs: Creating a service account^]

.Result

The service account for the Connector VM is set up.

=== Set up permissions across projects

If you plan to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in different projects than the project where the Connector resides, then you'll need to provide the Connector's service account with access to those projects.

For example, let's say the Connector is in project 1 and you want to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in project 2. You'll need to grant access to the service account in project 2.

.Steps

. In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM service and select the project where you want to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

. On the *IAM* page, select *Grant Access* and provide the required details.
+
* Enter the email of the Connector's service account.
* Select the Connector's custom role.
* Select *Save*.

For more details, refer to https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role[Google Cloud documentation^]

=== Set up shared VPC permissions

If you are using a shared VPC to deploy resources into a service project, then you'll need to prepare your permissions. 

This table is for reference and your environment should reflect the permissions table when IAM configuration is complete.

|===

Notes:

. deploymentmanager.editor is only required at the host project if you are not passing firewall rules to the deployment and are choosing to let BlueXP create them for you. BlueXP will create a deployment in the host project which contains the VPC0 firewall rule if no rule is specified.

. firewall.create and firewall.delete are only required if you are not passing firewall rules to the deployment and are choosing to let BlueXP create them for you. These permissions reside in the BlueXP account .yaml file. If you are deploying an HA pair using a shared VPC, these permissions will be used to create the firewall rules for VPC1, 2 and 3. For all other deployments, these permissions will also be used to create rules for VPC0.

. For data tiering, the tiering service account must have the serviceAccount.user role on the service account, not just at the project level. Currently if you assign serviceAccount.user at the project level, the permissions don't show when you query the service account with getIAMPolicy.

== Step 3: Enable Google Cloud APIs

Several Google Cloud APIs must be enabled before you can deploy the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud.

.Step

. Enable the following Google Cloud APIs in your project:
+
include::_include/google-cloud-apis.adoc[]

https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis[Google Cloud documentation: Enabling APIs^]

== Step 4: Install the Connector

Create a Connector directly from the BlueXP web-based console, by using gcloud, or by installing the software on your own Linux host.

.Before you begin

You should have the following:

* The required Google Cloud permissions to create the Connector and a service account for the Connector VM.
+
link:task-set-up-permissions-google.html[Learn how to set up Google Cloud permissions]

* A VPC and subnet that meets networking requirements.
+
link:task-set-up-networking-google.html[Learn about networking requirements]

* Details about a proxy server, if a proxy is required for internet access from the Connector.

.Steps

. Select the *Connector* drop-down and select *Add Connector*.
+
image:screenshot_connector_add.gif[A screenshot that shows the Connector icon in the header and the Add Connector action.]

. Choose *Google Cloud Platform* as your cloud provider.

. On the *Deploying a Connector* page, review the details about what you'll need. You have two options:

.. Select *Continue* to prepare for deployment by using the in-product guide. Each step in the in-product guide includes the information that's contained on this page of the documentation.

.. Select *Skip to Deployment* if you already prepared by following the steps on this page.

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the Connector:

* If you're prompted, log in to your Google account, which should have the required permissions to create the virtual machine instance.
+
The form is owned and hosted by Google. Your credentials are not provided to NetApp.

* *Details*: Enter a name for the virtual machine instance, specify tags, select a project, and then select the service account that has the required permissions (refer to the section above for details).

* *Location*: Specify a region, zone, VPC, and subnet for the instance.

* *Network*: Choose whether to enable a public IP address and optionally specify a proxy configuration.

* *Firewall Policy*: Choose whether to create a new firewall policy or whether to select an existing firewall policy that allows the required inbound and outbound rules.
+
link:reference-ports-gcp.html[Firewall rules in Google Cloud]

* *Review*: Review your selections to verify that your set up is correct.

. Select *Add*.
+
The instance should be ready in about 7 minutes. You should stay on the page until the process is complete.

.Result

After the process is complete, the Connector is available for use from BlueXP.
